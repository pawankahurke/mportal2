<h3>Scrips 4 and 58 Configuration</h3>

<p>Scrip 4 manages the process of retrying the process of sending
email logs when the email fails.  When the email fails, after a
certain delay, it is retried.  Every time it fails, that delay is
doubled before the next retry, up to a maximum delay.  Once the
decision is made to actually send the email, the actual send process
is scheduled at a random time in the future between a minimum and
maximum value.  Scrip 58 is run to actually send the email.
</p>

<h4>Scrip 4 Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip enabled</li>
<li>The range for random additional delay in seconds is set between 1 and 5 minutes</li>
<li>Initial delay in seconds before retrying failed web logs is set to 60 seconds</li>
<li>Maximum delay in seconds before retrying failed web logs is set to one hour</li>
</ul>

<p>These parameters are configurable.</p>

<h4>Scrip 58 Default Configuration Parameter</h4>

<p>Scrip 58 is a utility scrip that actually sends email logs after a delay,
either when they are first sent (by the engine), or when the operation is
being retried by Scrip 4 because of a failure. Its default configuration parameter is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrip enabled</li>
</ul>
