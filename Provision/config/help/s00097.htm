<h3>Scrip 97 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip disabled</li>
<li><em>Sampling period in milliseconds</em> When Scrip 97 is enabled, the default value is 15000 milliseconds.</li>
<li><em>Report disk space (physical) now</em> disabled</li>
</ul>

<p>When enabled, Scrip 97 is executed by default every fifteen minutes. Default start times are set at 
11, 26, 41, and 56 minutes past the hour with a random 3-minute delay after
each start minute. This means that Scrip 97 will run from 0 to 3 minutes after 11
minutes past the hour, and the same for 26 minutes past the hour, etc..</p>

<p>The Scrip execution interval can be changed by simply changing the default schedule.</p>


<h4>Report disk space (physical) now</h4>

<p>With the <em>Execute</em> button, you can run Scrip 97 on demand, even if it's not enabled.
In Scrip 97, the <em>Execute</em> button can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or
on all supported systems.</p>

<h4>Schedule</h4>

<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each entered on a new line.</p>

<p>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>

<table border=1 bordercolor="#COCOCO" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Hours</TD>
<TD>1-24</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Day of the Month</TD>
<TD>1-31, depending on the month; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every day.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4</TD><TD>Month</TD>
<TD>1-12; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every month.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>5</TD><TD>Day of the Week</TD>
<TD>0, Sunday - 6, Saturday; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every day of the week.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>6</TD><TD>Minute Randomizer</TD>
<TD>N; the size of the time interval in minutes over which the Scrip should be randomly executed. We multiply N*60, then calculate a random number X between 1 and N*60, and run the Scrip X seconds after its scheduled time.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>7</TD><TD>Conditional Execution</TD>
<TD>N; N=1 means that if the Scrip is past due, it will be run immediately, N=2 means that If the Scrip is past due, it will be run at the next scheduled execution time. If the value is set to 2, the actual Scrip execution time will be within 3 minutes (either way) of the scheduled time. This is necessary to prevent the case where a process will not be executed if it is a little slow to start, or if the scheduler starts it a few seconds too early.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>8</TD><TD>Failed Run Limit</TD>
<TD>N, where N is the number of times that Scrip execution is allowed to fail before notification is sent to the support provider; N=0, the Scrip will NEVER report a failure, N=1, the Scrip will report EVERY failure, N=2, the Scrip will report if it failed twice in a row, and so on.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<p>The <em>Minutes</em>, <em>Hours</em>, <em>Day of the Month</em>, <em>Month</em>, and <em>Day of the Week</em> 
fields can have multiple values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</p>
<p>For example, a 1,3,5 entry for the <em>Minutes</em> parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed at 
minutes 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<p>A 10-14 entry for the <em>Hours</em> parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 
2 PM.</p>
<p>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by commas.</p>
