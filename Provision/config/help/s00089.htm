<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

<H4>Impersonation enabled</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Impersonation enabled</EM> parameter is enabled, ,
using the impersonation user id and password (and domain if
necessary) you entered in <EM>Impersonation Username</EM>,
<EM>Impersonation Password and Confirmation</EM>, and <EM>Impersonation
Domain</EM> parameters in the Scrip 43 configuration page, Scrip 89
can execute programs that reside or use resources on shared resources
on other systems on the the network, accessed either as mapped
drives(e.g. <STRONG>x:\shared folder</STRONG>), or using UNC
(Universal Naming Convention) syntax (e.g. <STRONG>\\server\\shared
folder</STRONG>).</P>
<H4>Executables</H4>
<P>Scrip 89 executes only one command line entered in the <EM>Executables</EM>
window. If you want to run multiple executables, they will have to be
included in a script or batch file.</P>
<P>Alternatively, especially if you want the executables to run at
different times, you can also use Scrips 212, 213, 214, and 215,
which are exact copies of Scrip 89.</P>
<H4>File Locations</H4>
<P>Scrip 89 executes the command line entered in its <EM>Executables</EM>
list. You can enter just the executable name (ftp.exe) or a specified
path (C:\download\internet\ftp.exe). When specifying a path, you may
use environment variables. If the file name does not contain a
directory path, the system searches for the executable file in the
following sequence:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The directory from which the
	application loaded 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The current directory for the

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windows 95/98: The Windows system

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Windows NT/2000: The 16-bit

	</P>
	<LI><P>The directories that are listed in the PATH environment
	variable 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>If the executable you wish to run is not in any of the locations
listed above, you will have to enter its full location path.
Otherwise, exection of the program will fail.</P>
<P>For executables residing on networked drives, you should enter the
UNC name of the location, e.g. <STRONG>\\[server name]\[shared
resource name]\</STRONG>. Using the logical drive name assigned to
the networked drive will not work.</P>
<P>If the networked drive is not available at the time Scrip 89 is
executed, it will simply fail to run the executable (script or batch
file).</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
