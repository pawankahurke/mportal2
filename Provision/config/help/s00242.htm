<H4>Note on eTrust EZ Antivirus virus definition management</H4>
<P>Unlike other anti virus software products ASI supports, eTrust EZ
Antivirus software does not keep the date associated with virus
definitions anywhere, not in the registry, not on a disk file, and
not in the dat file version info. eTrust EZ Antivirus does not even
display the date of the current virus definitions in the Help-&gt;About
dialog box.</P>
<P>Instead, eTrust EZ Antivirus software virus definition updates are
driven strictly by the version number of the definitions. 
</P>
<P>When deciding whether to update virus definition on a system,
Scrip 242 uses the version of the local virus definitions on a
system, and the version of the latest virus definitions available at
a site. There appears to be no way around this. We even tried
extracting the <I>File Creation</I> date and <I>File Last Modified</I>
date of the definition files themselves but it turns out that eTrust
EZ Antivirus does not set those dates correctly.</P>
<P>Scrip 242 compares dat version numbers and not dat dates. Although
the Scrip can't know the date of any set of virus definition files,
it can track the date when the definitions were last updated (whether
they were updated by Scrip 242 or not). This means that instead of
the Scrip 242 configurator containing the configuration parameter
<I>Maximum age of virus definitions in days</I> like Scrips 12 and 90
it contains the configuration parameter <I>Maximum days since last
definitions update</I>. Scrip 242 will post an event log onto the ASI
server when then number of days since a virus definition update
occurred is equal to or greater than the value you set in the <I>Maximum
days since last definitions update</I> configuration parameter
instead of logging when the virus definitions are older than a
<I>maximum</I> number of days as Scrips 12 and 90 do.</P>
<H4>Update from other accessible machines</H4>
<P>When you enabled the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM>
configuration parameter, Scrip 242 will replace the eTrust EZ
Antivirus virus definitions on each system where this option is
enabled with the newest virus definitions found on the sub-net where
the system is installed. If none of the other virus definition update
functions are enabled, Scrip 242 ends execution after this operation
is completed.</P>
<H4>Update from on-site server</H4>
<P>An <EM>on-site server</EM> is a system where eTrust EZ Antivirus
is installed, and that is known to consistently have up-to-date virus
definitions. For example this could be one system (or more than one)
where the virus definitions are updated manually to ensure that the
update is successful.</P>
<P>If the <EM>Update from on-site server</EM> configuration parameter
is enabled, Scrip 242 will look for newer virus definitions at the
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> list.
If the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM> configuration
parameter is enabled searching for newer virus definitions at
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM>
configuration parameter occurs after Scrip 242 has completed the
search for newer virus definitions on other accessible systems on the
sub-net.</P>
<H4>Update from vendor</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Update from vendor</EM> configuration parameter is
enabled, Scrip 242 will look for newer virus definitions from the
Computer Associates site using eTrust EZ Antivirus software. If Scrip
242 cannot find eTrust EZ Antivirus software, it logs this fact, and
ends execution. If either <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM>
or <EM>Update from on-site server</EM>, configuration parameters, or
both, are enabled, Scrip 242 will look for newer virus definitions
from the Computer Associates site only if it was not successful
finding newer virus definitions using the other two options.</P>
<H4>On-site server locations</H4>
<P>Each entry in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> configuration
parameter contains the full path for an on-site server. Each entry
should be on a separate line.</P>
<H4>Version of latest definitions</H4>
<P><STRONG>The <EM>Version of latest definitions</EM> parameter is
displayed for information only. It should not be modified under any
circumstances. If it were to be modified, Scrip 242 would not
function properly.</STRONG></P>
<P>The purpose of the <EM>Version of latest definitions</EM>
configuration parameter is to track the virus definition version for
all systems running eTrust EZ Antivirus software. As a result, when a
machine is searching for updates on other systems on the sub-net, it
simply accesses this list. It does not have to contact every machine
on the subnet. This minimizes local network traffic and bandwidth
usage. From the list's entries a system finds out the dates of virus
definitions available on the sub-net, and which system(s) has/have
them.</P>
<P>The format of <EM>Version of latest definitions</EM> configuration
parameter entries is as follows: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>version number</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>8723</P>
</UL>
<H4>Machines to report virus definition dates</H4>
<P>You use the <EM>Machines to report virus definition dates</EM>
configuration parameter to control which systems should report virus
definition dates on the systems on the sub-net. If you want all
systems on a sub-net to report virus definition dates, all you need
to enter in the list is a *. An empty list is equivalent to this
function being disabled.</P>
<H4>Maximum days since last definition update 
</H4>
<P>When the date of the eTrust EZ Antivirus virus definition database
files is older than the current date by the number of days specified
by the <EM>Maximum days since last definitions update</EM>
configuration parameter, or more, Scrip 242 will post this
information on the ASI server.</P>
<P>Please that the date used by Scrip 242 for this function is the
<I>last modified date</I> of the eTrust EZ Antivirus virus definition
files. 
</P>
<H4>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</EM>
configuration parameter helps minimize the likelihood that if only
one system has the latest (or newer) virus definitions, this system
not be flooded with requests for the newer virus definitions from
other systems. When the ASI client on a system successfully retrieves
virus definitions from the vendor's site, <EM>Maximum random delay
before update (minutes)</EM> ensures that requests for the newer
virus definitions from other systems do not occur simultaneously,
maxmimizing the probability the the system be able to service at
least one of the requests. Once that happens, the number of systems
that can provide the newer virus definitions is automatically doubled
(at least), ensuring that all requests will be fulfilled.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Maximum retries for obtaining local
updates</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">As its name suggests, the <I>Maximum
retries for obtaining local updates</I> configuration parameter lets
you set the number of times Scrip 242 will attempt to obtain the
newest virus definitions available on the sub-net from other systems
on the sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>3</B>.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Local update retry delay (minutes)</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">With the <I>Local update retry delay
(minutes)</I> configuration parameter, you set the time interval
between attempts Scrip 242 will make to obtain the newest virus
definitions available on the sub-net from other systems on the
sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>60 </B>minutes.</P>
<H4>Report when anti-virus product is not installed</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report when anti-virus product is not
installed</I> configuration parameter, on systems where eTrust EZ
Antivirus is not installed Scrip 242 will post a log on the ASI
server with this information. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">You might want to use this
configuration parameter periodically to find out which systems at a
site do not have anti virus software installed. In this way, you
would be able to intervene pro-actively and add anti virus protection
to unprotected systems before a virus infects them.</P>
<H4>Command line parameters</H4>
<P>Scrip 242 runs in silent mode with the -s parameter in the command
line. The -s parameter cannot be deleted.</P>
<H4>Update eTrust EZ Antivirus now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 242 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 242, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
