<h3>Scrip 91 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip enabled</li>
<li><em>Disks to scan</em> Scrip 91 scans all local drives, except drives A: and B: ("My Computer" command line parameter)</li>
<li>Runs in "silent" mode (/UINONE command line parameter)</li>
<li>Scrip runs  at 3am every Wednesday and Friday</li>
<li><em>Run McAfee VirusScan now</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Disks to scan</h4>

<p>You can change the value of this parameter by simply deleting the default value and entering the drive letter of
each drive you want scanned followed by a colon, e.g. <strong>c:</strong>. The entry for each drive you want
scanned should be on a separate line.</p>

<h4>Command Line Parameters</h4>

<p>Version 1.0 of Scrip 91 does not allow the addition of any McAfee VirusScan command line 
parameters to the execution of McAfee VirusScan except for drive selection.</p>

<p>/UINONE, the "silent" mode command line parameter, cannot be deleted.</p>

<h4>Run McAfee VirusScan now</h4>

<p>With the <em>Execute</em> button, you can run Scrip 91 on demand, even if it's not enabled.
In Scrip 91, the <em>Execute</em> button can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or
on all supported systems.</p>

<h4>Schedule</h4>

<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each entered on a new line.</p>

<p>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>

<table border=1 bordercolor="#COCOCO" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Hours</TD>
<TD>1-24</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Day of the Month</TD>
<TD>1-31, depending on the month; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every day.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4</TD><TD>Month</TD>
<TD>1-12; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every month.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>5</TD><TD>Day of the Week</TD>
<TD>0, Sunday - 6, Saturday; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every day of the week.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>6</TD><TD>Minute Randomizer</TD>
<TD>N; the size of the time interval in minutes over which the Scrip should be randomly executed. We multiply N*60, then calculate a random number X between 1 and N*60, and run the Scrip X seconds after its scheduled time.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>7</TD><TD>Conditional Execution</TD>
<TD>N; N=1 means that if the Scrip is past due, it will be run immediately, N=2 means that If the Scrip is past due, it will be run at the next scheduled execution time. If the value is set to 2, the actual Scrip execution time will be within 3 minutes (either way) of the scheduled time. This is necessary to prevent the case where a process will not be executed if it is a little slow to start, or if the scheduler starts it a few seconds too early.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>8</TD><TD>Failed Run Limit</TD>
<TD>N, where N is the number of times that Scrip execution is allowed to fail before notification is sent to the support provider; N=0, the Scrip will NEVER report a failure, N=1, the Scrip will report EVERY failure, N=2, the Scrip will report if it failed twice in a row, and so on.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<p>The <em>Minutes</em>, <em>Hours</em>, <em>Day of the Month</em>, <em>Month</em>, and <em>Day of the Week</em> 
fields can have multiple values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</p>
<p>For example, a 1,3,5 entry for the <em>Minutes</em> parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed at 
minutes 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<p>A 10-14 entry for the <em>Hours</em> parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 
2 PM.</p>
<p>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by commas.</p>
