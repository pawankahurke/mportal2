<P><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><B>Before reading this
section, please note that it is extremely important that you NOT edit
the contents of the <I>Product list</I> parameter manually. Should
you do that, your edits would be overwritten by the settings entered
for each product on the provisioning and metering facility on the ASI
server. In addition, you would run the risk of losing or compromising
metering information on the applications whose <I>Product list</I>
parameter content you have changed, particularly if you make a
mistake, typographical or syntactical, when making the changes.</B></FONT></P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">If you want to change the
definition and configuration settings of a metered product please use
the ASI provisioning and metering facility browser based user
interface found at <A HREF="https://asiserverurl/main/provis/meter.php">https://asiserverurl/main/provis/meter.php</A>
(where asiserverurl is the URL of the ASI server used to manage your
sites)</FONT></B></P>
<P>The <I>Product list</I> parameter contains a list of the software
applications provisioned on the system whose Scrip 229 configuration
page you are viewing. It is stored as one product per line. The
format of an item in the list is:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">User id &ndash; the user id of the
	owner of the product, i.e. the user that defined the product on the
	ASI server.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Product name &ndash; the name
	assigned to the product when it was defined on the ASI server.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">0, 1 &ndash; meter / do not meter
	flag set to 0 if the product specified is not metered, 1 if it is
	metered.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Product key file(s) - The full
	path for the key files of the product specified. You can use a
	directory specification that may have an environment variable in it
	or wild cards (see section on directory wild cards at the end of

	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c:\Program Files\Microsoft

		the executables anywhere in the Adobe Photoshop installation
		directories )</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<H4>Minimum time between logs (seconds)</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Minimum time between logs (seconds)</EM> parameter
you control the minimum time interval between transactions logging
application metering information onto the ASI server. In between
logging transactions, information is accumulated. When it comes time
to log metering information, it occurs in a single transaction. 
</P>
<P>The <EM>Minimum time between logs (seconds)</EM> parameter is used
to reduce the load on the ASI server by moderating the frequency with
which Scrip 230 logs metering events to the ASI server. In addition,
Scrip 230 needs to be able to queue events in case the ASI server is
not immediately available, and the <EM>Minimum time between logs
(seconds)</EM> parameter is consistent with this requirement.</P>
<P>Please note that the ASI client does not try to resolve metered
application issues such as a missing process completion events. These
are resolved on the ASI server when metering reports are produced. 
</P>
<H4>Note about Scrip 230 execution</H4>
<P>Scrip 230 runs when one of the following events occurs:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you change the Scrip's
	schedule. When this happens, Scrip 230 enables or disables
	(depending on the whether Scrip 230 is enabled or not) the
	triggering mechanism used to detect execution of the applications
	specified in the <I>Product list</I> parameter.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the content of the <I>Product
	list</I> parameter changes. When this happens, the configuration of
	the triggering mechanism is updated to match the settings as
	specified in the product list. 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>When you change the value of the <EM>Minimum time between
	logs (seconds)</EM> parameter. When this happens, the log timer is
	reset.</P>
	<LI><P>When executable events (process creation or process
	termination) of an application specified in the <I>Product list</I>
	parameter occur. Information about the events is recorded. If the
	minimum time has elapsed since the last logging of metering
	information onto the ASI server occurred, the recorded events are
	logged, otherwise the log timer is started. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When the time interval specified in the <EM>Minimum time
	between logs (seconds)</EM> parameter expires. When this happens,
	metering information (any recorded instances of execution of the
	applications specified in the <I>Product list</I> parameter)
	accumulated since the last logging transaction occurred are logged
	onto the ASI server. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>On client startup. If Scrip 230 is enabled, the triggering
	mechanism used to detect execution of the applications specified in
	the <I>Product list</I> parameter is activated.</P>

<P>The <EM>Minutes</EM>, <EM>Hours</EM>, <EM>Day of the Month</EM>,
<EM>Month</EM>, and <EM>Day of the Week</EM> fields can have multiple
values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</P>
<P>For example, a 1,3,5 entry for the <EM>Minutes</EM> parameter
would mean that a Scrip would be executed at minutes 1, 3, and 5.</P>
<P>A 10-14 entry for the <EM>Hours</EM> parameter would mean that a
Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 2 PM.</P>
<P>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by
commas.</P>
<H4>Directory path wild card support</H4>
<P>Certain repetitive system maintenance and management tasks require
access to sub-directories that have the same name but have different
parent directories. For example, clean-up of temp directories on
systems running the Microsoft Windows NT based operating systems
(NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003), requires access to each user's temp
directory located in <I>[drive}:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user
name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp</I>. 
</P>
<P>In order to make it easier for you configure Scrips to perform
such repetitive tasks, we have implemented wild card directory
support, allowing wild cards anywhere in a directory path. This means
that in the example above, specification of the path for the temp
directory on all systems would be reduced to a single line:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">*:\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
Wild card directory support applies to any Scrip where you may need
to specify a directory path, including Scrips 60, 61, 100, 196, 222,
225, 229, and 230. It also extends to devices, meaning that you can
use the wild card character for devices including:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fixed drives (like hard disk
	partitions)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Removable drives (like floppies)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Network drives</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CD-ROMs</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RAM disk drives</P>
	<LI><P>Unknown drive types</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\\*\c:\Windows\**\temp</PRE><P>
would scan the <I>temp</I> directory found zero or more levels below
the <I>Windows</I> directory on the <I>c:</I> drive on all reachable
systems on the local network.</P>
<P>The notation used for wild card directory support is slightly
different from the MS-DOS wild card notation. It consists of either <B>*</B>
or <B>**</B>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>*</B> matches exactly one
	directory level.</P>
	<LI><P><B>**</B> matches zero or more directory levels.</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\**\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover all directory levels where the end path consists of
<I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I> including:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
and</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
while</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover only one directory level above <I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I></P>
<P>You can use multiple instances of <B>*</B> and/or <B>**</B> in
directory path specifications. When the directory wild card support
software finds instances of multiple wild cards, it performs
left-to-right scan that looks through directories 
</P>
<P>recursively. Please note that his means that multiple <B>**</B> or
<B>*</B> in a directory path specification can cause a lot of
multiple scans through the same directory structure, which will take
a lot of time, but it will return the correct result.</P>
