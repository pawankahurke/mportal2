<H4>Definitions and important notes</H4>
<P><I>RealVNC</I> users please note. Although Scrip 236 supports
UltraVNC, it will not interfere with an existing <I>RealVNC</I>
installation. In fact, you can use your <I>RealVNC</I> client running
in listen mode on the remote computer to take control of the target
system where the UltraVNC server installed by Scrip 236 is running.</P>
<P>Please note that <B>before</B> you use Scrip 236 to initiate
remote control of the system whose Scrip 236 configuration page you
are accessing (<B>target computer</B>), you will need to run the
remote control software in <I>listen mode</I> on the computer (<B>remote
computer</B>) from which you will be controlling the <I>target
computer</I>. It is important to ensure that only ONE remote control
software client process is running at any one time on the <I>remote
computer</I>.</P>
<P>This means that the remote control software needs to be installed
on the <I>remote computer</I> (<B>remember, this is the system that
takes over the target computer</B>) before you use Scrip 236.</P>
<P>If the <I>remote computer</I> is accessing a <I>target computer </I>at
an external site, i.e. a site accessible via the Internet, and the
<I>remote computer</I> does not have a public IP address, the entry
for the <I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration parameter
should be the public IP address or URL of the Internet gateway device
used by the <I>remote computer</I>.</P>
<P>In addition, the firewall for the network where the remote
computer is located should be configured to forward traffic incoming
via port 5500 (the default port used by the remote control software)
to the remote computer.</P>
<P>For example, suppose you want to configure Scrip 236 to initiate a
remote control session from your computer (remote computer) on server
X at customer site ABC. Let's also assume that your computer has a
private IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.250), and that the Internet
gateway at your site is a device with the service.provider.com URL.</P>
<P>The entry in the <I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration
parameter would be service.provider.com (or its public IP address).
In addition, the firewall on your network would be configured to
forward incoming port 5500 (or whichever port you have specified in
the <I>Listener port (Blank defaults to 5500)</I> configuration
parameter) traffic to the device at 192.168.1.250 (the private IP
address of your computer).</P>
<P>Please note that to identify the public IP address of your
Internet gateway you can simply start an Internet browser session and
enter the following <A HREF="http://checkip.dyndns.org/">http://checkip.dyndns.org/</A>
in the browser's address box.</P>
<P>If Scrip 236 finds that the UltraVNC, or RealVNC process
(winvnc.exe for both) is running when it starts up, it will stop it.</P>
<P>After completing a remote control session, if you wish to leave
the UltraVNC server process running on the target system, simply
close the remote control window. Do not terminate the process using
the taskbar icon.</P>
<P>Before using Scrip 236, you should also increase the frequency of
execution of Scrip 177 (Scrip Configuration Update) to ensure that
execution of Scrip 236 will occur quickly after you trigger its
execution from the ASI server. We suggest that Scrip 177 be
configured to run once every three minutes. While it's not necessary,
you may want to revert the Scrip 177 schedule to the settings you
normally use after the remote control sessions are over.</P>
<P>You can configure Scrip 236 in two ways:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accessing its configuration page
	either on your ASI server, or directly at a site, or</P>
	<LI><P>Using the remote control configuration wizard on the ASI
	server (<A HREF="https://asiserverdomain/main/config/remote.php">https://asiserverdomain/main/config/remote.php</A>)</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Please note that whenever you change one of the configuration
parameters of Scrip 236, the Scrip will run updating, if necessary,
the UltraVNC configuration on the system whose Scrip 236
configuration you just changed. For example, if you disable the </B><EM><B>Place
remote support icon on desktop</B></EM> <B>configuration parameter,
Scrip 236 will run and remove the remote support icon from the
desktop of the system where you disabled the configuration parameter.</B></P>
<H4>Connection testing</H4>
<P>When Scrip 236 runs on the <I>target computer</I> it first tries
to get a response from the <I>remote computer</I>. The Scrip will
open and close the port using the <I>remote computer</I> listed in
the the <I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration parameter
(see below). If this attempt to establish a connection succeeds,
Scrip 236 will connect to that remote computer.</P>
<P>The Scrip will try to connect with the first host listed in the
<I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration parameter. If it
receives a response, it will use that address to attempt a
connection. If it doesn't get the expected response, Scrip 236 will
attempt to establish a connection with next <I>remote computer</I>
listed in the <I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration
parameter. If none of the <I>remote computers</I> listed in the
<I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration parameter respond to
Scrip 236's request for a connection, the Scrip will post an event
log with that information on the ASI server, and won't try to
establish a connection.</P>
<P>Please note that At this point in time there is no way for Scrip
236 to know which device is responding to its connection request.
This means that it is susceptible to &ldquo;false positive&rdquo;. If
another program responds to Scrip's connection request, a &ldquo;false
positive&rdquo; will result in as much as the Scrip will try connect
with the device that responded. 
</P>
<H4>Disable tray icon</H4>
<P>As the name of the <EM>Disable tray icon</EM> configuration
parameter suggests, enabling it will remove the remote control
utility icon from the target computer's system tray.</P>
<H4>Run UltraVNC as a service</H4>
<P>When the <I>Run UltraVNC as a service</I> configuration parameter
is enabled (its default state), the UltraVNC server will run as a
service. This results in a number of benefits:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the UltraVNC server runs a
	service on a system that is logged off, UltraVNC will not generate
	the display of the UltraVNC server properties control panel.</P>
	<LI><P>The ASI client will not attempt to open a remote session
	connection before the UltraVNC server starts running which would
	result in a failed remote control session</P>
</UL>
<H4>Default password 
</H4>
<P>If Scrip 236 finds that the UltraVNC server password is blank, it
sets it to the value you entered in the <I>Default password</I>
configuration parameter.</P>
<P><B>We strongly advise you to change the default password the first
time you use the remote control utility.</B></P>
<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

<P>The icon placed on the desktop is the ASI icon.</P>
<P>By default, the <EM>Place remote support icon on desktop</EM>
configuration parameter is disabled.</P>
<H4>Remote support icon label (Blank defaults to 'Start remote

<P>In the <I>Remote support icon label</I> configuration parameter,
you can enter any text to replace the default remote support icon
label (<B>Start remote support</B>).</P>
<H4>Address of remote computer</H4>
<P>In the <I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration parameter
you should enter the IP address(es) or name(s) of the <I>remote
computer(s)</I>, where <I>remote computer</I> is as defined in the
<I>Definitions and important notes</I> section above.</P>
<P>The IP addresses or names of <I>remote computers</I> must be be
listed one per line. For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">192.168.0.1</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">245.45.6.100</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">nanoheal.org</P>
	<LI><P>hfn.tellink.net</P>
</UL>
<P>If you choose to specify a port for a <I>remote computer</I>,
enter a colon after the name or IP address of the <I>remote computer</I>,
and then enter the port number, with no spaces in between. For
example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">192.168.0.1:5800</P>
	<LI><P>tellink.net:2345</P>
</UL>
<P>A port number doesn't have to be attached to the IP address or
name of a <I>remote computer</I> listed in the <I>Address of remote
computer</I> configuration parameter. If you enter only ports and no
<I>remote computer</I> IP addresses or name, Scrip 236 will fail to
connect the <I>target computer</I> to any device.</P>
<P>Scrip 236 will identify the port to use as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Scrip 236 will use the port
	attached to the IP address or name of a <I>remote computer</I>
	listed in the <I>Address of remote computer</I> configuration
	parameter, if there is one.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If no port is attached to the IP
	address or name of a <I>remote computer</I> listed in the <I>Address
	of remote computer</I> configuration parameter, Scrip 236 will use
	the port listed in the <I>Listener port</I> configuration parameter.</P>
	<LI><P>If there are no entries in the <I>Listener port</I>
	configuration parameter, the Scrip will use <B>5500</B>, the default
	port.</P>
</UL>
<P>If Scrip 236 detects that the port entries in the <I>Address of
remote computer</I> or <I>Listener port</I> configuration parameters
are invalid, it will use <B>5500</B>, the default port.</P>
<P><B>Please note that if the <I>remote computer</I> is accessing a
<I>target computer </I>at an external site, i.e. a site accessible
via the Internet, and the <I>remote computer</I> does not have a
public IP address, the entry for the <I>Address of remote computer</I>
configuration parameter should be the public IP address or URL of the
Internet gateway device used by the <I>remote computer</I>. </B>

<P><B>For example, suppose you want to configure Scrip 236 to
initiate a remote control session from your computer (remote
computer) on server X at customer site ABC. Let's also assume that
your computer has a private IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.250), and that
the Internet gateway at your site is a device with the
service.provider.com URL.</B></P>
<P><B>The entry in the <I>Address of remote computer</I>
configuration parameter would be service.provider.com (or its public
IP address). In addition, the firewall on your network would be
configured to forward incoming port 5500 (or whichever port you have
specified in the <I>Listener port (Blank defaults to 5500)</I>

in the browser's address box.</B></P>
<H4>Listener port (Blank defaults to 5500)</H4>
<P>The <I>Listener port (Blank defaults to 5500)</I> configuration
parameter lets you identify an IP port different from the default
(5500) for the remote control software on the <I>target</I> computer
to use to communicate with the <I>remote</I> computer. 
</P>
<P>The value of the <I>Listener port (Blank defaults to 5500)</I>
configuration parameter can be different for each <I>remote</I>
computer. In this way, you can have multiple systems at your site
conducting remote control sessions with different <I>target</I>
computers <B>at the same time</B>. 
</P>
<P><B>As described in the <I>Address of remote computer</I> section
of this configuration help file, please keep in mind that you will
need to configure the firewall at your site to forward traffic
incoming to each of the IP ports entered in the <I>Listener port
(Blank defaults to 5500)</I> configuration parameter for each of the
target systems to the corresponding remote computer.</B></P>
<H4>Run now</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <B>Execute</B> button in the <I>Run now</I>

accessing (the <I>target computer</I>).</P>
<H4>Shutdown now</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <B>Execute</B> button in the <I>Shutdown now</I>

configuration page you are accessing.</P>
<H4>Uninstall on shutdown</H4>
<P>If the <EM>Uninstall on shutdown</EM> configuration parameter is
set to <B>local</B>, clicking on the Execute button will cause Scrip
236 to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Terminate execution of the remote

<P>on the system whose Scrip 236 configuration page you are
accessing.</P>
<P><STRONG>If the <EM>Uninstall on shutdown</EM> configuration
parameter is set to global, the above actions will be performed on
every system on the sub-net.</STRONG></P>
<H4>Remote control software installation executable download URL</H4>
<P>The current version of Scrip 236 supports only the VNC family of
remote control utilities. For your convenience, we have placed a copy
of the UltraVNC installation executable in the publicly accessible
<I>download</I> folder on <A HREF="http://www.handsfreenetworks.com/">www.handsfreenetworks.com</A>.
The Remote control software installation executable download URL for
the UltraVNC installation executable at this location is</P>
<P><B>http://www.handsfreenetworks.com/download/UltraVNC-Setup.exe</B></P>
<P>If you leave the <EM>Remote control software installation
executable download URL</EM> parameter blank, Scrip 236 will
automatically download the installation executable for UltraVNC from
the above location.</P>
<P>In the <I>Remote control software installation executable download
URL</I> configuration parameter you specify the location where the
installation executable for the remote control software is located
and the file name. 
</P>
<P>The path leading to the remote control software installation
executable must be visible on all the machines you want to run the
executable on. This means that if the executable is on a networked
drive then the drive must be accessible on all the machines through
an appropriately configured drive letter mapping.</P>
<P>If the installation executable is located on a networked drive,
you can enter either the UNC name of the location, e.g. <STRONG>\\[server
name]\[shared resource name]\</STRONG>, or the mapped drive letter if
one has been assigned to the networked drive.</P>
<P>The remote control software installation executable can also
reside on FTP or Web servers (HTTP or HTTPS).</P>
<P>FTP servers can be accessed via a URL scheme that uses a common
syntax for IP-based protocols. The syntax of a command line for
having Scrip 196 retrieve a patch executable from a FTP server is:</P>
<P><STRONG>ftp://user:password@host:port/url-path</STRONG>. 
</P>
<P>The <EM>user</EM>, <EM>password</EM>, or <EM>port</EM> can be
omitted, and defaults will be applied. The default <EM>user</EM> is
<STRONG>anonymous</STRONG>. The default <EM>password</EM> is a
fictitious email address (most FTP servers that allow anonymous login
either ignore the password or require an email address). The default
<EM>port</EM> is <STRONG>21</STRONG>, which is the standard FTP port.
</P>
<P><EM>Url-path</EM> can merely be the name of the remote file
(current working directory for the FTP server assumed), or it can
denote a particular subdirectory path to the file, e.g.,
dir/dir/dir/filename.</P>
<P><EM>host</EM> is either the name or IP address of the FTP server.</P>
<P>Scrip 236 captures all FTP commands executed when running a patch
located on a FTP server. They will be logged automatically onto the
ASI server if the patch download process fails.</P>
<P>Web servers can be accessed using HTTP or secure HTTP (HTTPS) via
a URL scheme that uses a common syntax for IP-based protocols. The
syntax of a command line for having Scrip 196 retrieve a patch
executable from a Web server is:</P>
<P><STRONG>http://user:password@host/url-path</STRONG>, or
<STRONG>https://user:password@host/url-path</STRONG></P>
<P>For publicly accessible Web pages, the <EM>user</EM> and <EM>password</EM>
are not necessary, and should be omitted.</P>
<P><EM>Url-path</EM> can merely be the name of the remote file
(current working directory for the Web server assumed), or it can
denote a particular subdirectory path to the file, e.g.,
dir/dir/dir/filename.</P>
<P><EM>host</EM> is either the name or IP address of the Web server.</P>
<P>Scrip 236 captures all HTTP commands executed when running a patch
located on a Web server. They will be logged automatically onto the
ASI server if the patch download process fails.</P>
<P>Please note that capitalization of the name of the patch/software
update executable in the path parameter of a Scrip 196 command line
needs to match capitalization of the patch/software update name on
the FTP or HTTP/HTTPS server. Otherwise, Scrip 196 will report a <STRONG>file
not found</STRONG> error. Generally speaking, to minimize the
probability of an error, it is advisable to use all-lower case names.</P>
<P>Each ASI server includes a folder called <STRONG>patches</STRONG>
located in the publicly accessible <STRONG>https://ASIserverURL/main/pub</STRONG>
directory. You can use the <STRONG>patches</STRONG> folder as a
convenient location from which the remote control software
installation executable can be downloaded by Scrip 236 using
HTTP/HTTPS, without requiring authentication. A sample Scrip 236
<EM>Remote control software installation executable download URL</EM>
for remote control software located in the folder <STRONG>patches</STRONG>
would look something like this:</P>
<P><STRONG>https//ASIserverURL/main/pub/patches/&lt;remote control
software installation executable file name&gt;</STRONG></P>
<P>Please remember that on each ASI server we have installed an FTP
server and created a a user id and password with upload access to the
<STRONG>patches</STRONG> folder to upload patches and installation
executables to this folder.</P>

<P>If the <EM>Uninstall now</EM> configuration parameter is set to

236 to remove the remote control software from the system whose Scrip
236 configuration page you are accessing.</P>
<P>If the <EM>Uninstall now</EM> configuration parameter is set to
<B>global</B>, clicking on the <B>Execute</B> button will cause Scrip
236 to remove the remote control software from every system on the

<H4>Note on uninstall and install</H4>
<P>If Scrip 236 detects an existing installation of the remote
control utility, it will not change any of the existing configuration
changes.</P>
<P>In some cases, re-installation of the remote control utility might
not work correctly unless the target computer is first restarted.
This is due to the fact sometimes uninstall of the remote control
utility does not succeed in removing certain dlls that might be
loaded at the time of the uninstall even though there is no active
remote session.</P>
<H4>Use intermediate server</H4>
<P>By default, the <I>Use intermediate server</I> configuration
parameter is enabled. The system with the IP address or host name
entered in the <I>Address of intermediate server</I> configuration
parameter will be used as the UltraVNC intermediate server. This
means, that both the system taking control (remote system), and the
system to be controlled (target computer) will create an incoming
connection through ports 5500 and 5900 on the selected intermediate
server computer. 
</P>
<P>With the the <I>Use intermediate server</I> configuration
parameter enabled, the only networking configuration you will need to
make is to open ports 5500 and 5900 for incoming traffic forwarded to
your ASI server. 
</P>
<P>Although typically this is the case, you should also make sure
that port 5500 is open in the outbound direction at the site where
the target computer is located.</P>
<P>You will be able to take remote control of systems at your
customer sites from anywhere without making any additional
configuration changes.</P>
<H4>Maintain connection with intermediate server</H4>
<P>When the <I>Maintain connection with intermediate server</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, every time the ASI client
starts-up Scrip 236 will run to ensure that the UltraVNC server is
running with an open outbound connection to the intermediate server.</P>
<P>This means that whenever a system is re-started (and every other
time the ASI client re-starts), Scrip 236 will ensure that the
UltraVNC server is running with an open outbound connection with the
intermediate server.</P>
<P>Whenever you want to take remote control of a system where the ASI
client is installed and running, and the <I>Maintain connection with
intermediate server</I> configuration parameter is enabled, the
remote control session will be established instantaneously.</P>
<P><B>Please note, however, that this functionality comes at the cost
of a lower level of security as on every system where the <I>Maintain
connection with intermediate server</I> configuration parameter is
enabled, port 5500 will always be open for outbound traffic.</B></P>
<P>After you enable the <I>Maintain connection with intermediate
server</I> configuration parameter, if you want to ensure that the
UltraVNC server is running on a system with an open outbound
connection to the ASI server, all you need to do is run Scrip 18
(Client Shut-down / Re-start), or Scrip 73 (System Restart).</P>
<H4>Address of intermediate server</H4>
<P>In the <I>Address of intermediate server</I> configuration
parameter, you enter the name of the one or more computers housing
the intermediate server software, which we call intermediate servers.
For each entry, you can enter the netBIOS name, domain name, or IP
address. If you enter multiple names (or IP addresses), each should
be on a new line. If for any reason, Scrip 236 fails to establish a
connection with the first system whose name or IP address is listed
in the <I>Address of intermediate server</I> configuration parameter,
Scrip will attempt to establish a remote control session via the
intermediate server next on the list, and move down the list until it
finds an intermediate server which accepts a connection.</P>
<P>If the <I>Address of intermediate server</I> configuration
parameter is left blank, and the <I>Use intermediate server</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, Scrip 236 will extract the domain
name of your ASI server (the server that is being logged to) from the
<I>HandsFree event management server URL list</I> configuration
parameter in Scrip 43, and use it as the UltraVNC intermediate
server. 
</P>
<P>If Scrip 236 cannot reach an intermediate server, it will post an
event log on your ASI server reporting the failure with the following
message <B>Connection failed: Unable to find listening intermediate
server client.</B> 
</P>
<H4>Connection ID (0 or 200-1999999)</H4>
<P>In order for you to be able to take remote control of a system
using the intermediate server you will need a unique identifier for
that remote control session. This is because in order to handle
multiple remote control session simultaneously, the intermediate
server needs a unique connection ID number for each remote control
session. In this way, it can distinguish among the remote control
sessions taking place at any one time. The connection ID number has
to be the same one for the remote system (the one taking control),
and the target system (the one being controlled). In this way, the
intermediate server can match them, and establish the link between
them necessary for the remote control session.</P>
<P>The <I>Connection ID (0 or 200-1999999)</I> configuration
parameter is an integer with a value between <B>200</B> and <B>1999999</B>.
When the value of The <I>Connection ID (0 or 200-1999999)</I>
configuration parameter is set to the default value of <B>0</B>,
Scrip 236 will generate a unique connection ID number based on the
UUID (Unique Universal ID) of the system where Scrip 236 is running. 
</P>
<P>Please note that because of the way it is generated, the
connection id number for a system will always be the same. This
means, that after the first time Scrip 236 runs on a system with the
<I>Use intermediate server</I> configuration parameter enabled, you
will know that system's connection id, and it will never change,
unless that system's UUID changes. 
</P>
<P>You can change the value of the <I>Connection ID (0 or
200-1999999)</I> configuration parameter as long you enter an integer
between <B>200</B> and <B>1999999</B>.</P>
<P>If you decide to assign a different connection id to each system
at your sites, you need to make sure that:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>You assign a unique connection id to each system</P>
	<LI><P>When you enter the unique connection id for a system in the
	<I>Connection ID (0 or 200-1999999)</I> configuration parameter in
	its Scrip 236 configuration page, the <I>Connection ID (0 or
	200-1999999)</I> configuration parameter is set to <B>local</B>.</P>
</OL>
<P>If the value of the <I>Connection ID (0 or 200-1999999)</I>
configuration parameter is not within the allowed range, Scrip 236
will post an event log on your ASI server reporting the error with
the following message <B>Error: Invalid ID number. No connection can
be made. A valid ID number is between 200 &ndash; 1999999</B>.</P>
<H4>Initiate Connection Automatically</H4>
<P>The <I>Initiate Connection Automatically</I> configuration
parameter is used by the ASI server software to remind users how a
remote control session was initiated the last time Scrip 236 ran. It
has no effect on how Scrip 236 runs.</P>
<P>Please note that disabling or enabling the <I>Initiate Connection
Automatically</I> configuration parameter via the Scrip 236
configuration page has no effect whatsoever on the way Scrip 236
runs. The value of the <I>Initiate Connection Automatically</I>
configuration parameter is controlled by the ASI server software, and
changed by user actions performed when using the remote control
wizard on the ASI server.</P>
<P>If a remote control session is initiated by a system's user
clicking on the remote support icon placed by Scrip 236 on a system's
desktop, the <I>Initiate Connection Automatically</I> configuration
parameter is disabled.</P>
<P>If a remote control session takes place by execution of Scrip 236
initiated on the ASI server, the <I>Initiate Connection Automatically</I>
configuration parameter is enabled.</P>
