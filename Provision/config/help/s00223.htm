<H4>ASI client installation and deployment</H4>
<P>When the ASI client comes up on the first system where the generic
ASI client installation executable has been run, it is in a <EM>dormant</EM>
configuration with a minimum number of Scrips enabled. One of the
Scrips that is enabled is Scrip 223. The first thing this Scrip does
is to check whether or not the ASI client has been configured. If it
hasn't, then it displays a dialog box asking for the ten-digit site
registration code. It checks the internal consistency of the code,
using the check digit, and keeps asking until it gets one that is
internally consistent.</P>
<P>Once the ASI client installation and deployment Scrip has the
ten-digit site registration code, it makes a remote call to the ASI
installation management facility asking for the site installation and
deployment information. This is the information that you entered for
the site on the ASI installation management facility; the information
that is in cust.ini when the ASI client is installed using a custom
installation executable. This information allows the ASI client to be
deployed for operational use.</P>
<P>Since it controls the application of the start-up and follow-on
Scrip configurations, Scrip 223 effectively manages both the initial
installation of the ASI client and its operational deployment.</P>
<P>If the ASI client is installed on a system connected to a sub-net
where the ASI client is already installed and running on other
systems, Scrip 223 performs a series of tasks to facilitate the site
registration code entry process:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.25in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Arial Black">1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>If
Scrip 223 sees responses to the broadcast it sends after the with
execution of the installation executable is completed with more than
one site code, then it will leave the site registration code box in
the dialog box empty, and the dialog box includes the message: <B>&quot;No
default is provided because multiple codes are currently accessible
on this sub-net&quot;</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.25in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Arial Black">2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>If
the Scrip 223 doesn't see any responses to its broadcast, it doesn't
enter any suggested site code, and the dialog box includes the
message: <B>&quot;No default code is provided because no codes are
currently accessible on this sub-net&quot;</B>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.25in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Arial Black">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>If
the Scrip 223 sees responses to its broadcast with only one site
registration code, it uses that site registration code as a suggested
value, and the dialog box includes the message: <B>&quot;The default
code provided is the only one currently accessible on this sub-net&quot;</B>.
Please note that the person performing the installation needs to
explicitly accept the suggested site registration code value.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 1.25in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Arial Black">4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>If
the suggested site registration code in 3) is one generated by the
ASI client, as in the case of versions of the client that are
installed using a custom installation executable (one that has a
cust.ini file), then it will be used as the suggested site
registration code. However, if the person performing the installation
enters a legacy site registration code (one generated from the site
name contained in the cust.ini file), Scrip 223 will reject it, and
the rejection is accompanied by a dialog box that says: <B>&quot;Site
registration codes for sites where the ASI client was originally
installed with a custom installation executable are not valid&quot;</B>.</P>
<P>Please refer to the document titled <I>ASI Client Installation
Instructions</I> for step-by step ASI client installation
instructions.</P>
<H4>ASI client deployment changes</H4>
<P>You may want to change a site's installation and deployment
information after deployment has already started. For example, you
may want to change the follow-on phase Scrip configuration, or you
may want to change the duration of the start-up phase or the action
at the end of the start-up phase.</P>
<P>In order to change the deployment of the ASI client at a site
after the start-up phase is already under way, you would change the
configuration of Scrip 223 either by directly logging onto the ASI
client Scrip configurator on any system at the site using any
browser, or logging onto the ASI server configuration module.</P>
<P><STRONG>You should be extremely careful about using Scrip 223
after deployment of the ASI client at a site is completed. You can
use it to:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>Disable or enable Scrips
	by changing the value of the Scrips enabled at start-up parameter </STRONG>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>Place the ASI clients at a
	site in start-up configuration mode by giving the Delay before start
	of follow-on phase (minutes) parameter a value greater than the one
	originally given. If you do this, you can also change the value of
	the Scrips enabled at start-up parameter. You can also remove the
	ASI client at a site by enabling the Check box if you want follow-on
	action to uninstall ASI client option. </STRONG>
	</P>
	<LI><P><STRONG>Remove the ASI client from all systems at a site by
	enabling the Check box if you want follow-on action to uninstall ASI
	client option. This can be done independently from changes made to
	any of the other parameters. </STRONG>
	</P>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>If you accidentally change the value of the Site
registration code parameter, the ASI client will prompt you to
re-enter the correct value. If you change the change the value of the
Site registration code parameter to another valid registration code,
the ASI client will automatically contact the ASI installation
management facility to retrieve the site, start-up and follow-on
configuration parameters from the new site profile, and re-deploy the
ASI client at the site.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Please note that any changes to the Site registration code
parameter should be made only via the Scrip configuration module on
the ASI server because changing a site's registration code also
changes the password used by the ASI clients when communicating to
each other. This means that a change to the registration code made
locally will not propagate.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>If you want to change the name of a site, creating a new
site profile record on the ASI installation management facility is an
easy and quick way to make this change remotely. Once the new site
profile record is created, simply change the value of the Site
registration code parameter to the new site registration code,
ensuring that you make this change using the Scrip configuration
module on the ASI server used by the site.</STRONG></P>
<H4>ASI installation process detail</H4>
<P>When you run the generic ASI client installation executable on the
first system at a site, Scrip 223 tries to load configuration data
from cust.ini. If that succeeds, a unique registration code is
generated from the site name that is in cust.ini. If loading data
from the file fails (for example because cust.ini is not present),
Scrip 223 prompts the user for the site registration code through a
dialog box. The dialog box will pop up until the user has entered a
valid site registration code.</P>
<P>If the e-mail distribution option is enabled, the ASI client
installation and deployment Scrip checks for the cookie from the ASI
installation management facility that contains the site registration
code. The ASI client will look the cookie in the browser (Microsoft
Internet Explorer) cookie directory. The location does not matter
because the ASI client uses a procedure call into a special API to
get the cookie. The cookie is stored by the ASI installation
management facility when the user clicks on the URL download link in
the ASI client installation e-mail message.</P>
<P>Once the Scrip has a valid registration code, it tries to contact
the ASI installation management facility server (unless the data was
loaded from cust.ini). If it fails because the server is unreachable,
then a timer will be started to retry as described in the <I>Scrip
223 re-try mechanism</I> section below. If the contact fails because
the site is invalid, Scrip 223 will generate a dialog box asking the
user for a new registration code. If the contact succeeds, the Scrip
will load and activate the start-up Scrip configuration. If the Scrip
configuration was loaded from cust.ini, then Scrip 223 loads and
activates the follow-on Scrip configuration. In this way, the ASI
client installation process will work at existing sites.</P>
<P>After the start-up Scrip configuration is loaded and active, Scrip
223 will start the countdown to the start of the follow-on phase. The
length of the countdown is equal to the delay you entered in the site
installation and deployment information on the ASI installation
management facility. Each time Scrip 223 runs, it will re-compute the
remaining time. When the remaining time passes zero, the Scrip
executes the follow-on action that may consist of loading and
activating the follow-on Scrip configuration, placing the ASI client
in a dormant state, or uninstalling it.</P>
<H4>Scrip 223 re-try mechanism</H4>
<P>If the initial attempt to contact the ASI installation server when
the ASI client first starts up after installation fails, Scrip 223
will start re-trying to contact the ASI installation server at the
time you enter in the <I>Initial delay for install server retry, in
seconds</I> configuration parameter, then doubles the interval
between attempts to contact the ASI server each time until it gets to
the value you enter in the <I>Maximum delay for install server retry,
in seconds</I> configuration parameter at which point it doesn't
increase any more.</P>
<P>In order to spread out the impact on the connection, whenever a
time is computed for contacting the ASI installation server, a random
number of seconds between 0 and the value in you enter in the <I>Random
offset for install server retry, in seconds</I> configuration
parameter is added to the time.</P>
<P>Regardless of the values you enter in the <I>Initial delay for
install server retry, in seconds</I>, <I>Maximum delay for install
server retry, in seconds</I>, and <I>Random offset for install server
retry, in seconds</I> configuration parameters an maximum value of
<B>three days</B> is imposed on the re-try interval.</P>
<P>With its default values, after the ASI client is installed, after
initial ASI client start-up Scrip 223 will try to contact the ASI
installation server at these times:</P>
<P>0, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 35 minutes, 1 hour and 15 minutes, 2
hours and 35 minutes, 5 hours 15 minutes, 10 hours 35 minutes, 21
hours 15 minutes. Each of these times will be delayed by a random
interval between 0 and 2 minutes.</P>
<P>If the attempts to contact the ASI installation server at the
times listed above fail, Scrip will contact the ASI installation
server once per day after that. 
</P>
<P>Every time the ASI client starts, Scrip 223 will try to contact
the ASI installation server, and then it will try again once per day,
every day after that.</P>
<P>If the local ASI repository gets corrupted, it will start the 0, 5
min, etc. sequence over.</P>
<H4>Site registration code</H4>
<P>The <EM>Site registration code</EM> is the ten-digit registration
code that uniquely identifies a site.</P>
<H4>Scrips enabled at start-up</H4>
<P><EM>Scrips enabled at start-up</EM> is a comma separated list of
the Scrips that you want eenabled at the beginning of the start-up
phase. If the list is a single asterisk, all Scrips will be enabled.
If the list is empty, The ASI client is in a dormant state. No Scrips
are enabled except the minimum set necessary for you to be able to
activate the client at a time of your choosing.</P>
<P>A sample <EM>Scrips enabled at start-up</EM> list is:</P>
<P><STRONG>9,12,15,18,19</STRONG></P>
<P>You can use a text editor to build your list and cut and paste
into the <EM>Scrips enabled at start-up</EM> list.</P>
<H4>Scrips enabled at start of follow-on phase</H4>
<P><EM>Scrips enabled at start of follow-on phase</EM> is a comma
separated list of the Scrips that you want eenabled at the beginning
of the start-up phase. If the list is a single asterisk, all Scrips
will be enabled. If the list is empty, The ASI client is in a dormant
state. No Scrips are enabled except the minimum set necessary for you
to be able to activate the client at a time of your choosing.</P>
<P>A sample <EM>Scrips enabled at start of follow-on phase</EM> list
is:</P>
<P><STRONG>9,12,15,18,19</STRONG></P>
<P>You can use a text editor to build your list and cut and paste
into the <EM>Scrips enabled at start-up</EM> list.</P>
<H4>Delay before start of follow-on phase (minutes)</H4>
<P><EM>Delay before start of follow-on phase (minutes)</EM>
represents the length of the start-up phase of the ASI client
deployment measured in minutes.</P>
<H4>Check box if you want follow-on action to uninstall ASI client</H4>
<P>If the <EM>Check box if you want follow-on action to uninstall ASI
client</EM> box is checked, the ASI client will be uninstalled from
the system at the end of the start-up phase.</P>
<H4>Initial delay for install server retry, in seconds</H4>
<P>If the initial attempt to contact the ASI installation server when
the ASI client first starts up after installation fails, in the
<I>Initial delay for install server retry, in seconds</I>
configuration parameter you enter the amount of time Scrip 223 should
wait before starting to re-try to contact the ASI installation
server.</P>
<H4>Global Maximum delay for install server retry, in seconds</H4>
<P>When Scrip 223's ASI server contact re-try interval reaches the
value you enter the <I>Maximum delay for install server retry, in
seconds</I> configuration parameter, it will stop re-trying to
contact the ASI server.</P>
<H4>Global Random offset for install server retry, in seconds</H4>
<P>In the <I>Random offset for install server retry, in seconds</I>
configuration parameter you enter the range in which the calculated
random number of seconds added to the re-try time will fall.</P>
