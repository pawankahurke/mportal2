	<LI><P><EM>Check monitored items now</EM> 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Continuously monitor for changes</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Continuously monitor for changes</EM> configuration
parameter is enabled, Scrip 161 will detect changes to the registry
keys listed in the<EM> Registry keys to be monitored</EM>
configuration parameter as they happen, and will prevent changes to
the keys being monitored, if so configured. When this configuration
parameter is disabled, Scrip 161 will only check for changes when it
is scheduled to run. Please note that enabling this configuration
parameter can impact performance if the registry keys being monitored
are many, and are very active.</P>
<H4>Registry keys to be monitored</H4>
<P>The <EM>Monitored items</EM> parameter contains the list of
directories and files monitored by Scrip 161. Each item to be
monitored is entered on a new line. The format of an item in the list
is:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>0</B> (disable) or <B>1</B>
	(enable) - this makes it possible to temporarily stop monitoring
	selected registry keys without deleting the corresponding registry
	key to be monitored command line from the list. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sub-key monitor flag - If it is
	set to <B>1</B>, Scrip 161 will monitor all sub-keys. When this flag
	is set to <B>0</B>, Scrip 161 will ignore any sub-keys contained in
	the registry key being monitored. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Operating system &ndash; the value
	of this parameter can be <B>9x</B>, if the operating system running
	on the system is either MS Windows 95, 98, 98SE, or Me, or <B>nt</B>,
	if the operating system running on the system is either MS Windows
	NT4, 2000, XP, or Server 2003.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protection - If this flag is set
	to <B>1</B> Scrip 161 will prevent any changes to be made to
	registry keys being monitored. When this flag is set to <B>0</B>,
	Scrip 161 will only detect and report changes made to monitored
	registry keys. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Registry key path - The full path for a registry key you want
	Scrip 161 to monitor</P>
</UL>
<P>An example of <EM>Registry keys to be monitored</EM> configuration
parameter entry is: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><STRONG>1,0,1,NT,HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Nico Mak
	Computing\WinZip</STRONG> - This command line is enabled. It covers
	the WinZip registry key ignoring all sub-keys, and monitors and
	prevents any changes 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that when a command line in the <EM>Monitored items</EM>
parameter is disabled, the stored information about the registry key
and its sub-keys is removed. When a command line is enabled, the
information about the registry key and its sub-keys is re-generated.</P>
<H4>Note about Scrip 161 execution</H4>
<P>Scrip 161 runs when one of the following events occurs:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the ASI client starts up.
	When this happens it checks for changes 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you click on the execute
	button to the right of the <EM>Check monitored items now</EM> label.
	When this happens it checks for changes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At its scheduled time. When this
	happens it checks for changes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When monitored item(s) change.
	When this happens it checks for changes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one of its configuration
	parameter changes. When this happens it updates the configuration. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When it is enabled/disabled. When this happens it updates the
	configuration. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Checking for changes means:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Determining if any files or
	directories have been removed, added or altered, and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Updating the stored information about any item that has
	changed 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Updating the configuration means updating the stored information
about monitored item(s) to match their current state. If any existing
stored information for monitored item(s) is still relevant, then it
is re-used. 
</P>
<P>If you enabled protection for a command line in the <EM>Monitored
items</EM> parameter(value set to 1), instead of just updating the
stored information (checksum contained in the ASI client's persistent
state repository) for the item(s) in that command line, when an item
changes, Scrip 161 will restore the item to its pre-change state by
overwriting the changed item with the copy that was stored in the
hidden directory <I>161</I> contained in the ASI client directory
when the item was first added to a (part of) <EM>Monitored items</EM>
parameter command line.</P>
<P>Please note that Scrip 161 will restore any protected file or
directory with the backup copy stored in the not only if an attempt
is made to change them but also if they are deleted.</P>
<P>If you change the copies of the files and/or directories you have
configured Scrip 161 to monitor (and protect) that are stored in
directory 161, the Scrip will not update the changed item's (or
items') checksum information until it is disabled and then
re-enabled, or the ASI client is restarted.</P>
<H4>Check monitored items now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 161 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 161, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
