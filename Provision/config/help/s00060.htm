<P>For your convenience, we offer six Scrips that are exact copies of
each other to perform folder and file clean-up operations. They are
Scrips 60, 217, 218, 219, 220, and 221.</P>
<P>In this way, you can manage clean-up operations of different
classes of folders and files in a more straightforward, and less
error-prone fashion.</P>
<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

using the impersonation user id and password (and domain if
necessary) you entered in <EM>Impersonation Username</EM>,
<EM>Impersonation Password and Confirmation</EM>, and <EM>Impersonation
Domain</EM> parameters in the Scrip 43 configuration page, Scrip 60
(and 217-221) can clean up folders that reside on shared resources on
other systems on the the network, accessed either as mapped
drives(e.g. <STRONG>x:\shared folder</STRONG>), or using UNC
(Universal Naming Convention) syntax (e.g. <STRONG>\\server\\shared

<H4>Directories or files to scan</H4>
<P><EM>Directories or files to scan</EM> configuration parameter
entries have the following format with each value in an entry
separated by a comma, and no spaces before or after each comma:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Entry status with possible values
	equal to 0, 1, or 2, corresponding respectively, to disabled,

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sub-directory deletion flag. If it
	is set to 1, Scrip 60 (and 217-221) will delete all sub-directories

	</P>
</UL>
<P>When specifying a directory, you can use wild cards (see section
on directory wild cards at the end of this document).</P>
<P>This means that in a <EM>Directories to clean</EM> entry you could
specify the following path:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>*\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>A <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM> entry with the above path
specification would delete files matching the file group specified in
the entry, in all user profiles' <I>temp</I> folders on all logical
drives on a system.</P>
<P>Please note that if a <EM>Directories to clean</EM> entry contains
the full path for a file, you do not need to have a file group
parameter. 
</P>
<P>The presence of a <I>file group</I> parameter in a <EM>Directories
or files to scan</EM> entry, implies that the third parameter is a
directory. In that case Scrip 60 (and 217-221) checks to see if the
third parameter exists on the local machine as a directory. If it
does, It will process it. If it doesn't, the Scrip will check to see
if the third parameter exists as a file. If it does exist as a file
the entry will be flagged as invalid and log posted by the Scrip will
include an explanation of the error it found. If the third parameter
doesn't exist as a file, and Scrip 60 (and 217-221) cannot find the
directory. it assumes that the directory currently does not exist on
the local machine, and leaves the <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM>
entry enabled.</P>
<P>You can have as many <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM>
configuration parameter entries as you want, each entered on a new
line.</P>
<H4>File groups</H4>

	</P>
</UL>
<P>When specifying file masks, you can use the standard Microsoft
MS-DOS wild card characters <STRONG>?</STRONG> and <STRONG>*</STRONG>
in both the file name and extension.</P>
<P>You can have as many <EM>File groups</EM> configuration parameter
entries as you want with each file group entered on a new line.</P>
<H4>Delete read-only files</H4>
<P>When you enable the <EM>Delete read-only files</EM> configuration
parameter, Scrip 60 (and 217-221) will delete all files and
directories that match the criteria you set in the <EM>File groups</EM>
and <EM>Minimum age of files to be deleted (days)</EM> configuration
parameters 
</P>
<H4>Minimum age of files to be deleted (days)</H4>
<P>In the <EM>Minimum age of files to be deleted (days)</EM>
configuration parameter you enter the minimum age of deleted files
measured in days. It can be any integer number equal to, or greater
than <B>0</B>.</P>
<H4>Run folder clean-up now</H4>
<P>With the <I>Run folder clean-up now</I> <EM>Execute</EM> button,
you can run Scrip 60 (and 217-221) on demand, even if it's not
enabled. The <I>Run folder clean-up now</I> <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system, or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>A note on temporary files clean-up</H4>
<P>You should note that on Microsoft Windows NT based systems (NT4,
2000, XP, and Server 2003), there are two locations where temporary
files accumulate:</P>

</UL>
<P>The majority of temporary files will be found in the second
location listed above.</P>
<H4>A note on Internet browser files clean-up</H4>
<P>Scrip 60 (and 217-221) can be used to clean-up an Internet brwoser
temporary files, cookies, and history files.</P>

<P>A 10-14 entry for the <EM>Hours</EM> parameter would mean that a

<P>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by

<H4>File Deletion</H4>
<P>Scrip 60 (and 217-221) deletes files permanently. It does not send
them to the recycle bin.</P>
<H4>Directory path wild card support</H4>
<P>Certain repetitive system maintenance and management tasks require
access to sub-directories that have the same name but have different
parent directories. For example, clean-up of temp directories on
systems running the Microsoft Windows NT based operating systems
(NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003), requires access to each user's temp
directory located in <I>[drive}:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user
name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp</I>. 
</P>
<P>In order to make it easier for you configure Scrips to perform
such repetitive tasks, we have implemented wild card directory
support, allowing wild cards anywhere in a directory path. This means
that in the example above, specification of the path for the temp
directory on all fixed and network drives would be reduced to a
single line:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">*:\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
Wild card directory support applies to any Scrip where you may need
to specify a directory path, including Scrips 60 (and 217-221), 61,
100, 196, 222, 225, 229, and 230. It also extends to devices, meaning
that you can use the wild card character for devices including:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fixed drives (like hard disk
	partitions)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Removable drives (like floppies)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Network drives</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CD-ROMs</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RAM disk drives</P>
	<LI><P>Unknown drive types</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\\*\c:\Windows\**\temp</PRE><P>
would scan the <I>temp</I> directory found zero or more levels below
the <I>Windows</I> directory on the <I>c:</I> drive on all reachable
systems on the local network.</P>
<P>The notation used for wild card directory support is slightly
different from the MS-DOS wild card notation. It consists of either <B>*</B>
or <B>**</B>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>*</B> matches exactly one
	directory level.</P>
	<LI><P><B>**</B> matches zero or more directory levels.</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\**\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover all directory levels where the end path consists of
<I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I> including:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
and</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
while</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover only one directory level above <I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I></P>
<P>You can use multiple instances of <B>*</B> and/or <B>**</B> in
directory path specifications. When the directory wild card support
software finds instances of multiple wild cards, it performs
left-to-right scan that looks through directories 
</P>
<P>recursively. Please note that his means that multiple <B>**</B> or
<B>*</B> in a directory path specification can cause a lot of
multiple scans through the same directory structure, which will take
a lot of time, but it will return the correct result.</P>
