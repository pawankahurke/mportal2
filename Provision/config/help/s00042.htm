<h3>Scrip 42 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip enabled</li>
<li><em>Timeout for Ctl-Alt-Del (seconds)</em> 60</li>
<li><em>Dialog text</em> <strong>You have been locked out of your system because of a wrong password.
Please click on OK, then press the Ctrl, Alt, and Del keys simultaneously
to automatically reset your password.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Timeout for Ctl-Alt-Del (seconds)</h4>

<p>The parameter <em>Timeout for Ctl-Alt-Del (seconds)</em> lets you
define the amount of time the Scrip will wait for the user to type Ctl-Alt-Del after he/she
has clicked <em>OK</em> in the dialog box containing the <em>Dialog text</em>.
If the user waits longer than that, Scrip 42 just completes execution and reports that the password was not
reset.</p>

<h4>Dialog text</h4>

<p>This parameter is used to enter the content of the message displayed when a user is locked out of his/her 
system because of having entered an incorrect password for a number of times that exceeeds the number of
failures allowed as defined in the system's security policy.</p>

<h4>Important note</h4>

<p>Please note that in the default configuration on
Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP based systems, the need to press simultaneously the Ctrl-Alt-Del keys at
start-up before logging onto a system is disabled. In this case, Scrip 42 automatically initiates the Courier Direct 
password reset procedure without displaying the dialog box with the message contained in <em>Dialog text</em>.
In order to account for this system configuration, Scrip 42 delays taking action for 1-2 seconds, 
to see if the Courier Direct dialog comes up, before displaying the dialog box with the <em>Dialog text</em> message.</p>

<p>We should also note that on Microsoft Windows XP based systems
Scrip 42 will not work when the "Welcome Screen" feature is enabled
This is also true for the Courier Direct application. In fact, it disables the "Welcome Screen" feature.</p>
