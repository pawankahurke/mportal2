<H4>Report unknown logs</H4>
<P>When the parameter <EM>Report unknown logs</EM> is enabled, Scrip
77 will report the addition of undocumented logs to the event log,
and their content.</P>
<H4>Polling interval (minutes, 0=none)</H4>
<P>The <I>Polling interval (minutes, 0=none)</I> configuration
parameter can be used to work around the problem described in the
following Microsoft knowledge base
article:<BR>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q245609</P>
<P>Based on the problem described in the article referred to above,
the worst that could happen is that there would be a delay in seeing
an event log until the next time that either another one happened, or
the system re-started. The way Scrip 77 works, you will NEVER miss
seeing an event log.</P>
<P>However, we felt that the best approach would be to give you the
option to have Scrip 77 based on event detection (the default and
preferred approach, with the <I>Polling interval (minutes, 0=none)</I>
configuration parameter set to <B>0</B>), or based on polling. 
</P>
<P>With polling, if you have some events that are really time
critical, and it is imperative that you see every event at most 10
minutes after it happens, for example, then you will be able to do
that. All you need to do is set the <I>Polling interval (minutes,
0=none)</I> configuration parameter to <B>10</B>.</P>
<P>If you can live with the occasional problem in the operating
system that limits our ability to deliver real-time information, then
you can leave the <I>Polling interval (minutes, 0=none)</I>
configuration parameter set to <B>0</B>, which is the way we suggest
running it.</P>
<H4>Event logs to monitor for changes</H4>
<P>In addition to the default entries, you can add the name of custom
event logs to the <EM>Event logs to monitor for changes</EM> list,
each on a separate line.</P>
<H4>Security audits</H4>
<P>Please note:</P>
<P>Success audit - Success audit events are security events that
occur when an audited access attempt is successful. For example, a
successful logon attempt is a success audit event.</P>
<P>Failure audit - Failure audit events are security events that
occur when an audited access attempt fails. For example, a failed
attempt to open a file is a failure audit event.</P>
