<H4>Reporting Thresholds</H4>
<P>Reporting thresholds for page reads per second and the three types
of memory monitored by Scrip 96 can be used to alert the support
provider about potential memory shortage conditions. This also has
the effect to regulate the Scrip's logging activity. 
</P>
<P>The reporting threshold for page reads per second can be any
number. When set to 0, Scrip 6 will log memory statistics every
fifteen, the default logging period. When it is set to a very large
number, typically more than 300, Scrip 6 will log memory statistics
rarely.</P>
<P>Reporting threshold for free memory can vary between 100 and 0.
When a reporting threshold is set to 100, in practice this means that
Scrip 6 will log memory statistics every 15 minutes, the defaul
logging period. When a reporting threshold is set to X, where X is
between 0 and 100, this means that Scrip 6 will log memory statistics
every 15 minutes, if the value of the memory metric for which the
threshold was set to X, falls below X. When a reporting threshold is
set to 0, in practice this means that Scrip 6 will log memory
statistics very rarely.</P>
<P>Of the three metrics, experience shows that a high page reads per
second value typically represents the most reliable indicator of a
potential memory shortage as it tends to indicate that the processor
is forced to access mass storage to get the necessary data at a high
rate. This, in turn, leads to degraded system performance.</P>
<P>You should note that Scrip 6 will log the value of all memory
metrics whenever the threshold value of any one memory metric is
exceeded.</P>
<H4>Limit number of processes logged to</H4>
<P>When the <I>Report running processes</I> configuration parameter
is enabled, Scrip 6 will report detailed information about a number
of processes equal to the value of the <I>Limit number of processes
logged to</I> configuration parameter in descending order by reported
memory utilization. The default value of the <I>Limit number of
processes logged to</I> configuration parameter is <B>10</B>. If the
value of the <I>Limit number of processes logged to</I> configuration
parameter is set to <B>0</B>, and the <I>Report running processes</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, Scrip 6 will report detailed
information about all processes running on the system at the time
Scrip 6 posted its event log.</P>
<H4>Report running processes</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report running processes</I> configuration
parameter, when Scrip 6 runs the event log it posts on the ASI server
will include the list of processes running at the time its execution.
</P>
<P>Please be aware that event logs including the list of running
processes can be fairly large (&gt;50 Kbytes). If Scrip 6 thresholds
are set too low, the number of Scrip 6 logs generated can number in
the thousands per system per day. If the <I>Report running processes</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, the result can be high network
connection and mass storage capacity utilization on the ASI server.</P>
<H4>Report memory now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 6 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 6, the <EM>Execute</EM> button can
be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all supported
systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
