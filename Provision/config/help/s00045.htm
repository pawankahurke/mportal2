<h3>Scrip 45 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip enabled</li>
<li><em>Ports to include for logging</em> set to include all ports</li>
<li><em>Ports to exclude for logging</em> set to exclude none</li>
</ul>


<h4>Ports to include for logging</h4>

<p>The <em>Ports to include for logging</em> list contains the IP services ports that you want Scrip 45 to
monitor for probing by another system. </P>

<p>As indicated by the <strong>*</strong>, by default this list includes all IP services ports.</p>

<p>Entries in the <em>Ports to include for logging</em> list should be separated by a comma with no spaces.</p>

<h4>Ports to exclude for logging</h4>

<p>The <em>Ports to exclude for logging</em> list contains the IP services ports that you want Scrip 45 to
not monitor for attempts to probe by other systems. You might want to use this parameter to
list ports that you know are being scanned for a known reason. In such a case Scrip 45's
detection of a port probe would be superfluous.</P>

<p>By default, this list is empty.</p>
