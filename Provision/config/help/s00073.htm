</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.52in">Shuts down the system and then

<UL>
	<LI><P>Action = 4</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.52in">Shuts down a system to a point at
which it is safe to turn off the power. All file buffers have been
flushed to disk, and all running processes have stopped.</P>
<H4>Names of machines to reboot</H4>
<P>Scrip 73 reboots the systems whose names you enter in the <EM>Names
of machines to reboot</EM> list. If you want all systems on a sub-net
to be rebooted all you need to enter in the list is a *. An empty
list is equivalent to the Scrip being disabled.</P>
<P>When you want to reboot more than one system, each system's name
should be on a separate line.</P>
<P>The name of each system you want to reboot can be found in the
<EM>Computer name</EM> window on the <EM>Identification</EM> panel in
the <EM>Network</EM> properties in the Microsoft Windows / Windows NT
Control Panel. Alternatively, you can simply click on the <EM>Home</EM>
link at the top left-hand corner of the Scrip configuration page.
Doing this will take you to them main Scrip configuration page which
lists the names of all systems on which the Automated Support
Infrastructure client is installed.</P>
<H4>Names of processes to shutdown</H4>
<P>This parameter is used to list all the processes you would like
Scrip 73 to shut down in an orderly fashion before starting the
reboot sequence. The full name of each process to be terminated
should be entered on a separate line. Full location paths are not
required.</P>
<P>This configuration entry should be used with care. For example,
you should not use either of the masks <STRONG>*</STRONG> or <STRONG>*.*</STRONG>
because they would have the effect of terminating both the Client and
kernel32.dll, which are necessary for executing Scrip 73 (the
Client), and perform the system reboot (kernel32.dll).</P>
<P>At the time of a scheduled or on-demand system reboot, there may
be processes running that need to be shut down, and that may require
user action or response in order to be terminated. For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Open network connections that in
	order to be closed require user approval 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Applications like Microsoft Word
	that require a user to save or close without saving files that have
	been changed and not saved at the time Word is terminated, or 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Information agents like Intuit Quickbooks' qbdagent.exe. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Scrip 73 handles these situations automatically. You can control
process shut-down with the <EM>Max number of seconds to wait for the
process to close</EM> and <EM>Max number of dialogs to close</EM> 
</P>
<H4>Max number of seconds to wait for the process to close</H4>
<P>Once the system reboot sequence has been initiated, this parameter
lets you control how long Scrip 73 should wait before shutting down
each process that was active at the time.</P>
<H4>Max number of dialogs to close</H4>
<P>In many instances, requests for user action communicated via
dialog boxes are part of process shut down sequences. Scrip 73
handles these requests automatically.</P>
<P>Whenever a dialog box appears during a process' shut down sequence
requesting user input, Scrip 73 closes it taking the default action.
For example, if the dialog box requests whether a file should be
saved or not, and the default response is <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>, Scrip
73 will automatically click on the <STRONG>Yes</STRONG> button.</P>
<H4>Reboot system now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 73 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 73, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip only on the local system.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
