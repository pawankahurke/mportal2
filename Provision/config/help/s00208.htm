<h3>Scrip 208 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip disabled</li>
<li><em>Names of machines to perform update</em> all machines</li>
<li>When enabled, the Scrip runs at 5 AM and 4 PM daily with a random delay of one hour</li>
<li><em>Download software update now</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In order for Scrip 208 to run on a system, it has to be enabled, AND its name has to be in 
the <em>Names of machines to perform update</em> list.</p>


<h4>Names of machines to perform update</h4>

<p>You use the <em>Names of machines to perform update</em> list to control which systems should download
the ASI software and Scrip update. If you want all systems on a sub-net to be download
ASI software and Scrip updates, all you need to enter in
the list is a *. An empty list is equivalent to the Scrip being de-activated on all systems.</p>

<p>If a system is not in the <em>Names of machines to perform update</em> list, it will not attempt to 
download ASI software or Scrip updates, even though Scrip 208 may be enabled on it.</p>

<p>When you want to use more than one system to download ASI software and Scrip updated, 
each system's name should be on a separate line.</p>

<p>The name of each system that you want to use for downloading ASI software and Scrip updates can be found in the
<em>Computer name</em> window on the <em>Identification</em> panel in the 
<em>Network</em> properties in the Microsoft Windows / Windows NT Control Panel.
Alternatively, you can simply click on the <em>Home</em> link at the top left-hand corner of the Scrip configuration page. 
Doing this will take you to them main Scrip configuration page which lists the names of all systems on which the Automated 
Support Infrastructure client is installed.</p> 

<h4>Download software update now</h4>

<p>With the <em>Execute</em> button, you can run Scrip 208 on demand, even if it's not enabled.</p>

<p>However, if you attempt to run Scrip 208 using the <em>Execute</em> button on a system where the
Scrip is enabled but not in the <em>Names of machines to perform update</em> list, the Scrip will not run,
and post a log on the event log management database stating that the system where you tried to run Scrip 208 
is not in the <em>Names of machines to perform update</em> list.</p>


<h4>Schedule</h4>

<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each entered on a new line.</p>

<p>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>

<table border=1 bordercolor="#COCOCO" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<TR><TD>  

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Field Number</STRONG>   </TD>
<TD>  </p>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Field Name</STRONG>    </TD>
<TD>  </p>

<p align="center"><STRONG>Field Values and Description</STRONG>    </TD>
<TD>  </p>
</TR>

<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>Minutes</TD>
<TD><p>0-60</p>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Hours</TD>
<TD>1-24</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Day of the Month</TD>
<TD>1-31, depending on the month; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every day.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4</TD><TD>Month</TD>
<TD>1-12; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every month.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>5</TD><TD>Day of the Week</TD>
<TD>0, Sunday - 6, Saturday; a value of * means that the Scrip should be run every day of the week.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>6</TD><TD>Minute Randomizer</TD>
<TD>N; the size of the time interval in minutes over which the Scrip should be randomly executed. We multiply N*60, then calculate a random number X between 1 and N*60, and run the Scrip X seconds after its scheduled time.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>7</TD><TD>Conditional Execution</TD>
<TD>N; N=1 means that if the Scrip is past due, it will be run immediately, N=2 means that If the Scrip is past due, it will be run at the next scheduled execution time. If the value is set to 2, the actual Scrip execution time will be within 3 minutes (either way) of the scheduled time. This is necessary to prevent the case where a process will not be executed if it is a little slow to start, or if the scheduler starts it a few seconds too early.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>8</TD><TD>Failed Run Limit</TD>
<TD>N, where N is the number of times that Scrip execution is allowed to fail before notification is sent to the support provider; N=0, the Scrip will NEVER report a failure, N=1, the Scrip will report EVERY failure, N=2, the Scrip will report if it failed twice in a row, and so on.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<p>The <em>Minutes</em>, <em>Hours</em>, <em>Day of the Month</em>, <em>Month</em>, and <em>Day of the Week</em> 
fields can have multiple values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</p>
<p>For example, a 1,3,5 entry for the <em>Minutes</em> parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed at 
minutes 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<p>A 10-14 entry for the <em>Hours</em> parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 
2 PM.</p>
<p>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by commas.</p>
