<h3>Scrip 186 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li><em>Maximum concurrent Scrips</em> Set to 10</li>
</ul>

<h4>Maximum concurrent Scrips</h4>

<p>Scrip 186 lets you control the number of Scrips that the Automated Support Infrastructure (ASI) client will
run concurrently.</p>

<p>You should be careful about setting the value of this parameter too high because of the potential negative 
impact it can have on system performance. Typically, setting <em>Maximum concurrent Scrips</em> to a value between 10 
and 20 should not have a noticeable impact on system performance.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that because Scrips perform system maintenance, and problem prevention and resolution 
activities, and problems are exceptional events, at any one time few Scrips will be running concurrently on any one 
system.</p>
