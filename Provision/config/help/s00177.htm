<H4>Using Scrip 177</H4>
<P>Please note that the default schedule for Scrip 177 includes a
<EM>Random minute</EM> value of <STRONG>50</STRONG>. This means that
the Scrip will run at a random point in time within 50 minutes of the
scheduled execution time.</P>
<P>This is necessary to minimize the probability that all clients
from all sites will try to access the site management facility at the
same time.</P>
<H5>A distributed approach</H5>
<P>On a network with 50 systems, Scrip 177 would be checking the ASI
server for Scrip configuration changes on average once per minute for
50 minutes out of every hour.</P>
<P>In general, Scrip 177's frequency of execution and randomizer
value can be combined in a simple algorithm to control the frequency
with which ASI clients from a site will check the ASI server for
Scrip configuration changes.
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Scrip 177 frequency of execution -
	<STRONG>Fsc</STRONG> (minutes)
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Frequency of any one ASI client
	checking the ASI server for Scrip configuration changes - <STRONG>Fc</STRONG>
	(minutes)
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Randomizer - <STRONG>R</STRONG>
	(minutes)
	</P>
	<LI><P>Number of ASI clients on sub-net - <STRONG>N</STRONG>
	</P>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Fsc = N * Fc</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>R = Fsc / FC</STRONG></P>
<P>Note than <STRONG>N = R</STRONG>.</P>
<P>For example, if you have 150 ASI clients on one sub-net and you
want any one of them to check for Scrip configuration changes once
per minute, <STRONG>Fsc = 150 * 1 = 150 minutes</STRONG>.</P>
<H5>A hierarchical approach</H5>
<P>You can use the above formula to implement a different way to use
Scrip 177. Define <STRONG>N1</STRONG> as the number of ASI clients on
a sub-net that you want to use the primary Scrip configuration
checking systems. Define <STRONG>N2</STRONG> as the number of systems
on the sub-net minus <STRONG>N1</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Apply the formula above choosing a very low value for Fc (no more
than a few minutes) when using <STRONG>N1</STRONG>, call it <STRONG>FC1</STRONG>,
and a relatively high value for FC (from a few to several hours) when
using <STRONG>N2</STRONG> call it <STRONG>FC2</STRONG>.</P>
<P>The hierarchical approach works well for two reasons:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The first system from which Scrip 177 reaches the ASI server
	configuration module, and finds one or more global configuration
	changes propagates them automatically to all other systems on the
	same sub-net.</P>
	<LI><P>When Scrip 177 from one system reaches the ASI server
	configuration module and finds a local variable change intended for
	one or more Scrips on another system, it will notify Scrip 177 on
	the other system. Scrip 177 on the other then runs and retrieve the
	local Scrip configuration changes intended for Scrips on its system.</P>
</UL>
<H5>Intermittently connected systems and multi-subnet sites</H5>
<P>Please note that when you configure Scrip 177 you should keep in
mind mobile/intermittently connected systems, individual remote
systems and, sites where systems are distributed across multiple
sub-nets.</P>
<P>The distributed or hierarchical approach to configuring Scrip 177
should be used for each sub-net at a site. This should also cover
systems that most of the time reside at remote sites, where each
remote site can be treated as a different sub-net, and may or may not
have a VPN, or similar, connection to the main site.
</P>
<P>With intermittently connected systems and individual remote
systems (e.g. a tele-worker's system), the conservative approach
would be to treat each one as being on its own sub-net. If you choose
this approach, however, we would advise against having Scrip 177 run
more frequently than four times per hour on any one system, except
for special cases as needed (e.g. single remote servers).</P>
<H4>Synchronize configuration with server</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 177 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 177, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>

<P>The <EM>Minutes</EM>, <EM>Hours</EM>, <EM>Day of the Month</EM>,
<EM>Month</EM>, and <EM>Day of the Week</EM> fields can have multiple
values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</P>
<P>For example, a 1,3,5 entry for the <EM>Minutes</EM> parameter
would mean that a Scrip would be executed at minutes 1, 3, and 5.</P>
<P>A 10-14 entry for the <EM>Hours</EM> parameter would mean that a
Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 2 PM.</P>
<P>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by
