<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

<H4>Impersonation enabled</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Impersonation enabled</EM> parameter is enabled, ,
using the impersonation user id and password (and domain if
necessary) you entered in <EM>Impersonation Username</EM>,
<EM>Impersonation Password and Confirmation</EM>, and <EM>Impersonation
Domain</EM> parameters in the Scrip 43 configuration page, Scrip 196
can execute patches or software updates that reside on shared
resources on other systems on the the network, accessed either as
mapped drives(e.g. <STRONG>x:\shared folder</STRONG>), or using UNC
(Universal Naming Convention) syntax (e.g. <STRONG>\\server\\shared
folder</STRONG>).</P>
<H4>How Scrip 196 works</H4>
<P>First, Scrip 196 searches the dialog boxes that appear during
installation of a patch or software update for buttons, including
radio buttons, which makes it work for license agreements.</P>
<P>If no buttons are found, or the Scrip can't read the text from any
of the ones that are found, and the <EM>Take dialog box default
action</EM> option is enabled, Scrip 196 sends an <STRONG>Enter</STRONG>
command to the dialog box.</P>
<P>If Scrip 196 finds buttons and can read the text that accompanies
them, it takes one of the following actions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If something in the <EM>Positive
	response keyword - take default action if found</EM> list is found
	in the text of a button that is not grayed out, and that text
	<EM>doesn't</EM> contain anything in the <EM>Negative exception
	keyword - do not take default action if combined with positive
	response keyword in one phrase</EM> list, Scrip 196 clicks on that
	button, 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Otherwise, Scrip 196 does not take any action. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The above process is repeated on a five-second cycle. If <EM>Max
minutes of run time per patch</EM> passes, or the maximum number of
dialogs is exceeded, Scrip 196 stops the installation process.</P>
<H4>Take dialog box default action</H4>
<P>If the <EM>Take dialog box default action</EM> option is enabled,
Scrip 196 will always take the default dialog box action overriding
any of the other options. While it may work in many cases, this
option should be used with care.</P>
<P>For example, If this option is enabled and the default action is
<STRONG>Cancel</STRONG>, Scrip 196 will take this action. Obviously,
this is not what you would like it to do.</P>
<P><B>In general, we advise you to leave the </B><EM><B>Take dialog
box default action</B></EM> <B>option disabled, and use the </B><EM><B>Negative
exception keyword - do not take default action if combined with
positive response keyword in one phrase</B></EM> <B>and </B><EM><B>Positive
response keyword - take default action if found</B></EM> <B>parameters
instead.</B></P>
<H4>Act on dialog boxes of all new processes</H4>
<P>If the <EM>Act on dialog boxes of all new processes</EM> option is
enabled, Scrip 196 will take the action corresponding to the value of
the <EM>Positive response keyword - take default action if found</EM>
parameter for all dialog boxes.</P>
<P>By default <EM>Act on dialog boxes of all new processes</EM> is
disabled. Scrip 196 will act only on dialog boxes that are created by
the patch / software update or subprocesses it creates. If <EM>Act on
dialog boxes of all new processes</EM> is enabled, it will act on
dialog boxes created by any process that started after the patch was
started. On Microsoft Windows NT based systems (NT4, 2000, XP, and
Server 2003), some installations create dialog boxes in the context
of the <EM>Service Manager</EM> and therefore require that the <EM>Act
on dialog boxes of all new processes</EM> option be enabled. If you
have a patch or software update where dialog boxes just open and
remain on the screen, enabling this option will probably make Scrip
196 act on them.</P>
<P>However, you should be aware that when <EM>Act on dialog boxes of
all new processes</EM> is enabled, you should make sure that the
patch or software update runs while the system is not in active use.
Otherwise, Scrip 196 will start acting on dialog boxes generated by
any programs after the patch or software update starts running.</P>
<H4>Names of processes to shutdown</H4>
<P>The <EM>Names of processes to shutdown</EM> parameter can be used
to list all the processes you would like Scrip 196 to shut down in an
orderly fashion before starting to run patches. The full name of each
process to be terminated, including extension, should be entered on a
separate line. Full location paths are not required.</P>
<P>This configuration entry should be used with care. For example,
you should not use either of the masks <STRONG>*</STRONG> or <STRONG>*.*</STRONG>
because they would have the effect of terminating both the ASI Client
and other processes (e.g. explorer.exe) that are necessary for
executing Scrip 196 (the ASI Client), and keep the system running
(explorer.exe).</P>
<P>One or more of the processes running at the time Scrip 196 is
scheduled to start that need to be shut down may require user action
or response in order to be terminated. For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Open network connections that in
	order to be closed require user approval 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Applications like Microsoft Word
	that require a user to save or close without saving files that have
	been changed and not saved at the time Word is terminated, or 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Information agents like Intuit Quickbooks' qbdagent.exe. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Scrip 196 handles these situations automatically. You can control
process shut-down with the <EM>Max number of seconds to wait for the
process to close</EM> and <EM>Max number of dialogs to close</EM> 
</P>
<P>The Scrip will also check for processes to shutdown before each
patch is installed, in case a process in the <EM>Names of processes
to shutdown</EM> list starts up again.</P>
<H4>Max number of seconds to wait for the process to close</H4>
<P>This parameter lets you control how long Scrip 196 should wait
before shutting down each process that was active at the time the
Scrip is scheduled to run.</P>
<H4>Max number of dialogs to close</H4>
<P>In many instances, requests for user action communicated via
dialog boxes are part of process shut down sequences. Scrip 196
handles these requests automatically.</P>
<P>Whenever a dialog box requesting user input appears during a
process' shut down sequence, Scrip 196 closes it taking the default
action. For example, if the dialog box requests whether a file should
be saved or not, and the default response is <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>,
Scrip 196 will automatically click on the <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>
button.</P>
<H4>Patches to apply</H4>
<P>The <EM>Patches to apply</EM> list contains the patch command
lines you would like Scrip 196 to run. You can have as many patch
command lines defined as you want with each entered on a new line.
Patch command lines have the following format, <STRONG>with each
parameter in a command line separated by a comma with no spaces</STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">blank, 0 or 1 - if 0 or blank,
	Scrip 196 does not log dialog boxes produced by patches. If 1, Scrip
	196 logs dialog boxes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">9x , nt or blank - the value of
	this command line parameter tells Scrip 196 which Microsoft Windows
	operating system family, the patch applies to. It is not case
	sensitive. If you leave it blank, Scrip 196 will attempt to apply
	the patch to all systems regardless of operating system. Please note
	that Microsoft Windows 95, 98, and Me belong to the 9x family while
	Microsoft Windows NT4, 2000, and XP belong to the NT family. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Full path, or URL (see below) of
	an executable 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Optionally, command line arguments for the executable.
	Command line arguments for the executable should be entered as you
	would enter them in the command line for the executable, each
	separated by a space. For example: <STRONG>-u -n -Z -Q</STRONG>. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The path(s) of the executables you want Scrip 196 to run must be
visible on all the machines you want to run the executable on. This
means that if the executable(s) are on a networked drive then the
drive must be accessible on all the machines through an appropriately
configured drive letter mapping.</P>
<P>For patches/updates residing on networked drives, you can enter
either the UNC name of the location, e.g. <STRONG>\\[server
name]\[shared resource name]\</STRONG>, or the mapped drive letter if
one has been assigned to the networked drive.</P>
<P>Patches/updates can reside on FTP or Web servers (HTTP or HTTPS).</P>
<P>FTP servers can be accessed via a URL scheme that uses a common
syntax for IP-based protocols. The syntax of a command line for
having Scrip 196 retrieve a patch executable from a FTP server is:</P>
<P><STRONG>ftp://user:password@host:port/url-path</STRONG>. 
</P>
<P>The <EM>user</EM>, <EM>password</EM>, or <EM>port</EM> can be
omitted, and defaults will be applied. The default <EM>user</EM> is
<STRONG>anonymous</STRONG>. The default <EM>password</EM> is a
ficticious email address (most FTP servers that allow anonymous login
either ignore the password or require an email address). The default
<EM>port</EM> is <STRONG>21</STRONG>, which is the standard FTP port.
</P>
<P><EM>Url-path</EM> can merely be the name of the remote file
(current working directory for the FTP server assumed), or it can
denote a particular subdirectory path to the file, e.g.,
dir/dir/dir/filename.</P>
<P><EM>host</EM> is either the name or IP address of the FTP server.</P>
<P>Scrip 196 captures all FTP commands executed when running a patch
located on a FTP server. They will be logged automatically onto the
ASI server if the patch download process fails.</P>
<P>Web servers can be accessed using HTTP or secure HTTP (HTTPS) via
a URL scheme that uses a common syntax for IP-based protocols. The
syntax of a command line for having Scrip 196 retrieve a patch
executable from a Web server is:</P>
<P><STRONG>http://user:password@host/url-path</STRONG>, or
<STRONG>https://user:password@host/url-path</STRONG></P>
<P>For publicly accessible Web pages, the <EM>user</EM> and <EM>password</EM>
are not necessary, and should be omitted.</P>
<P><EM>Url-path</EM> can merely be the name of the remote file
(current working directory for the Web server assumed), or it can
denote a particular subdirectory path to the file, e.g.,
dir/dir/dir/filename.</P>
<P><EM>host</EM> is either the name or IP address of the Web server.</P>
<P>Scrip 196 captures all HTTP commands executed when running a patch
located on a Web server. They will be logged automatically onto the
ASI server if the patch download process fails.</P>
<P>Please note that capitalization of the name of the patch/software
update executable in the path parameter of a Scrip 196 command line
needs to match capitalization of the patch/software update name on
the FTP or HTTP/HTTPS server. Otherwise, Scrip 196 will report a <STRONG>file
not found</STRONG> error. Generally speaking, to minimize the
probability of an error, it is advisable to use all-lower case names.</P>
<P>Each ASI server includes a folder called <STRONG>patches</STRONG>
located in the publicly accessible <STRONG>https://ASIserverURL/main/pub</STRONG>
directory. You can use the <STRONG>patches</STRONG> folder as a
convenient location from which patches and software update
executables can be downloaded by Scrip 196 using HTTP/HTTPS, without
requiring authentication. A sample Scrip 196 command line for
installing a patch located in the folder <STRONG>patches</STRONG>
would look something like this:</P>
<P><STRONG>1,,https//ASIserverURL/main/pub/patches/patch.exe</STRONG></P>
<P>On each ASI server we have also installed an FTP server and
created a a user id and password with upload access to the <STRONG>patches</STRONG>
folder to upload patches and installation executables to this folder.</P>
<P>Below, you will find some examples of Scrip 196 command lines:</P>

<P><STRONG>Please note that you should not use batch files in the
<EM>Patches to apply</EM> list. Scrip 196 operates on the dialog
boxes associated with the executable listed in the <EM>Patches to
apply</EM> list. If it were a batch file, then it would wait to close
the MS-DOS window opened by the batch file, not act on the dialog
boxes generated by the executables contained in the batch file.</STRONG></P>
<P>If you make a mistake in entering the path for the executable you
want Scrip 196 to install, the Scrip will report the error in an
event log uploaded to the ASI server.</P>
<P>Please keep in mind that the following characters cannot be used
in an FTP or HTTP URL:</P>
<P><STRONG>&lt; &gt; # % { } | ~ ^ [ ] ' \</STRONG></P>
<H4>Stop on an error</H4>
<P>If something goes wrong during the execution of Scrip 196, e.g.
one of the executables in the list is not found, you can choose to
continue with the execution of the other executables (this parameter
would be disabled), or stop execution of the Scrip (this parameter
would be enabled).</P>
<H4>Max minutes of run time per patch</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Max minutes of run time per patch</EM> parameter, you
can control execution of an executable preventing it from running
away and hanging the system. If the executable runs longer than the
value in <EM>minutes</EM> you give to this parameter, the Automated
Support Infrastructure (ASI) client will terminate its execution. A
value of 0 means that the executable can run without a time limit. 
</P>
<P>Please note that the time spent downloading a patch from an FTP or
Web server, is not included in the <EM>Max minutes of run time per
patch</EM> parameter unless the software update or patch executable
performs a donwload operation as part of the patch/software update
process.</P>
<H4>Patches installed</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Patches installed</EM> list, Scrip 196 keeps track of
patches it previously installed. As a result you don't have to remove
patches/software updates from the <EM>Patches to apply</EM> list
because the Scrip will not try to install a patch/softwatre update
that is already installed. If you need to force an update, all you
need to do is remove the entry for the patch/software update from the
<EM>Patches installed</EM> list. Please note that the entire line
needs to be removed not just the patch/software update name.

<H4>Apply patches now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 196 on demand,
