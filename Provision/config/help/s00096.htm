<H4>Reporting Thresholds</H4>
<P>When configuring Scrip 96, users can set reporting thresholds for
<EM>processor usage</EM>, <EM>Interrupts per second</EM>, and <EM>Queue
length</EM>. They can be used to alert the support provider about a
system with an under-powered processor, given the application mix run
by the end-user, or a potentially problematic application. Threshold
settings also have the effect to regulate the Scrip's logging
activity. 
</P>
<P>The reporting threshold for <EM>Interrupts per second</EM> can be
any number. When set to 0, Scrip 96 will log processor statistics
every fifteen, the default logging period. When it is set to a very
large number, typically more than , Scrip 96 will log processor
utilization statistics very rarely.</P>
<P>The reporting threshold for <EM>Queue length</EM> can be any
number. When set to 0, Scrip 96 will log processor utilization
statistics every fifteen minutes, the default logging period. When it
is set to a very large number, that varies depending on the processor
and operating system combination, Scrip 96 will log processor
utilization statistics very rarely.</P>
<P>Reporting threshold for <EM>processor usage</EM> can vary between
100 and 0. When a reporting threshold is set to 0, in practice this
means that Scrip 96 will log processor utilization statistics every
15 minutes, the defaul logging period. When the reporting threshold
is set to X, where X is between 0 and 100, this means that for that
Scrip 96 will log processor utilization statistics every 15 minutes,
if <EM>Usage percentage</EM> exceeds X. When <EM>processor usage</EM>
reporting threshold is set to 100, in practice this means that for
that Scrip 96 will log processor utilization statistics very rarely.</P>
<P>Of the three metrics, experience shows that a high <EM>Queue
length</EM> value typically represents the most reliable indicator of
a potential processing capacity shortage as it tends to indicate that
a large number of processes are waiting for processor capacity in
order to execute. This, in turn, leads to degraded application
performance.</P>
<P>You should note that Scrip 96 will log the value of all processor
metrics whenever the threshold value of any one metric is exceeded.</P>
<H4>Limit number of processes logged to</H4>
<P>When the <I>Report running processes</I> configuration parameter
is enabled, Scrip 96 will report detailed information about a number
of processes equal to the value of the <I>Limit number of processes
logged to</I> configuration parameter in descending order by reported
processor utilization. The default value of the <I>Limit number of
processes logged to</I> configuration parameter is <B>10</B>. If the
value of the <I>Limit number of processes logged to</I> configuration
parameter is set to <B>0</B>, and the <I>Report running processes</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, Scrip 96 will report detailed
information about all processes running on the system at the time
Scrip 6 posted its event log.</P>
<H4>Report running processes</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report running processes</I> configuration
parameter, when Scrip 96 runs the event log it posts on the ASI
server will include the list of processes running at the time its
execution. 
</P>
<P>Please be aware that event logs including the list of running
processes can be fairly large (&gt;50 Kbytes). If Scrip 96 thresholds
are set too low, the number of Scrip 96 logs generated can number in
the thousands per system per day. If the <I>Report running processes</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, the result can be high network
connection and mass storage capacity utilization on the ASI server.</P>
<H4>Report CPU usage now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 96 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 96, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
