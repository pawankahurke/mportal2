<h3>Run list parameters</h3>

<p>Scrip 192 helps you control the programs end-users run on their systems. It can be a powerful ally in
ensuring system stability and end-user productivity.</p>

<p>However, like any other powerful tool, it needs to be used with care.</p> 

<p>Specifically, this means that when
Scrip 192 is used with the <em>Run list</em> options enabled, you should ensure that all the programs necessary for 
end-users to do their job
be included in the <em>Allow these programs to run</em> and in the <em>Commonly running programs</em> lists.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that if you enable the <em>Use <STRONG>Run List</STRONG> parameters to allow execution of
selected programs</em> option and leave the <em><STRONG>Run List</STRONG> - Allow these programs to run</em> list EMPTY,
the system won't boot when the ASI client is running in as a service (the default mode of operation).<br>

On Microsoft Windows ME based systems, users won't even get a login prompt.<br>
On Microsoft Windows 2000 based systems, users will be able to login but will ony see a blue background.</strong></p>

<p> To minimize potential end-user problems, we suggest the following approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>On one system where the Automated Support Infrastructure (ASI) client is running and on which Scrip 192 is enabled,
start all the applications you want end-users to be able to run</li>

<li>Through Scrip 192's configuration screen, enable the <em>Include common programs</em> parameter, and then 
click on the <em>Execute</em> button next to the <em>Update list of common programs</em> parameter. This will populate
the <em>Commonly running programs</em> list with the name of all the programs running at that time. It will also
populate the <em>Commonly running programs</em> list on all systems on the local network with
the same programs.</li>

<li>Subsequently, you can use the <em>Update list of common programs</em> parameter to update the list of programs you
want to allow end users to run.</li>

<li>Use the <em>Allow these programs to run</em> parameter to customize the list of programs end-users are
allowed to run on a system-by-sytem basis</li>
</ul>

<p>You should note that <u>unless included explicitly</u> either in the <em>Commonly running programs</em> or
<em>Allow these programs to run</em> list, end-users will not be able to run executables such as:

<ul>
<li>setup.exe or any other installation executable</li>
<li>taskmgr.exe</li>
<li>Applets in the MS Windows <em>Control Panel</em></li>
<li>autorun.exe</li>
<li>winhelp.exe, the program necessary to access most applications' help files</li>
<li>Screen savers (programs with .scr extension)</li>
<li>rundll32.exe necessary, among other things, to change a system's date and time</li>

</ul>

<p>Before running Scrip 196 (<em>Software Patch Application</em>), you should disable Scrip 192 on all
the systems you want to apply a software patch to.</p>


<h4>Allow these programs to run</h4>

<p>Here, you should enter the full name of the program(s), including extension, whose execution you want to allow.
Location path should not be entered.</P>

<p>When more than one program is entered, each name should be on a separate line.</p>

<P>Scrip 192 detects the execution of the program(s) entered in the <em>Allow these programs to run</em>
list by matching these names with those of processes that are active on the system.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 of Scrip 192 detects all types of executables except for those with
the .com and .bat extensions.</p>


<h4>Include common programs</h4>

<p>Enabling this option, allows users to run the programs included in the <em>Commonly running programs</em>
list. </p>

<h4>Commonly running programs</h4>

<p>This list is populated automatically by Scrip 192. To do this, enable the <em>Include common programs</em>
option, and then click on the <em>Execute</em> button next to the <em>Update list of common programs</em> parameter. </p>

<h4>Very important note on program inclusion / exclusion</h4>

<p>The ASI client has a built-in list of programs whose execution it allows by default.
This list cannot be modified by a user.</p>

<p>This also means that including these programs in the <em>Stop these programs from running</em> list will have no effect. </p>

<p>At present this list consists of two programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>iexplore.exe</li>
<li>netscape.exe</li>
</ul>

<p>The Scrip configurator can be accessed only with a browser. Accidental exclusion of the two programs listed above
from the <em>Allow these programs to run</em> list or inclusion in the 
<em>Stop these programs from running</em> list would make it very difficult to access the Scrip configurator and, 
in all likelihood, require direct intervention by HandsFree Networks.</p>

<h4>Update list of common programs</h4>

When you click on the <em>Execute</em> button next to the <em>Update list of common programs</em> parameter,
Scrip 192 will automatically retrieve the name of the programs running on the <u>local</u> system at that time.
Scrip 192 will also populate the <em>Commonly running programs</em> list on all systems on the local network with
the same programs.</p>

<h3>Stop list parameters</h3>

<h4>Stop these programs from running</h4>

<p>Here, you should enter the full name of the program(s), including extension, whose execution you want Scrip 192 to terminate.
Location path should not be entered.</P>

<p>When more than one program is entered, each name should be on a separate line.</p>

<P>Scrip 192 detects the execution of the program(s) entered in the <em>Allow these programs to run</em>
list by matching these names with those of processes that are active on the system.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 of Scrip 192 detects all types of executables except for those with
the .com and .bat extensions.</p>


<p>Version 1.0 of Scrip 192 allows the termination of multiple programs entered in
the <em>Programs to prevent from running</em> window.</p>

<p>You should enter the full name of the executable, including extension. Location path should not
be entered. You can put arguments after an executable in the list and
the Automated Support Infrastructure (ASI) client will only stop the executable
if it is run with those arguments.</P>

<p>This is one way to keep a particular script from running. The argument characters in the list are compared against
the incoming argument characters (using a simple case insensitive compare).  If the compare succeeds for
the length of the arguments in the list then a match occurs otherwise it fails.<br><br>
For example:</p>

<table border=1 bordercolor="#COCOCO" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<TR><TD>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Incoming Command Line</STRONG>   </TD>
<TD>  </p>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Command Line in the Scrip 192 List</STRONG>    </TD>
<TD>  </p>

<p align="center"><STRONG>Matches?</STRONG>    </TD>
<TD>  </p>
</TR>
<TR><TD>WScript.exe virus.vbx /B</TD><TD>wscript.exe virus.vbx</TD>
<TD><p>Yes</p>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>wscript.exe virus.vbx</TD><TD>WScript.exe virus.vbx /B</TD>
<TD>No</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>wscript.exe virus.vbx strainA</TD><TD>wscript.exe VIRUS.vbx strain</TD>
<TD>Yes</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>wscript.exe virus.vbx</TD><TD>wscript.exe </TD>
<TD>Yes</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>calc.exe /A /B</TD><TD>calc.exe /B /A</TD>
<TD>No</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>All comparisons are case insensitive.</p>

<P>There is no wildcard matching in either the arguments or the executable name. Spaces before the arguments are ignored; all
other spaces are significant.</p>

<p>You should also note that Scrip 192 doesn't filter what is entered in the <em>Stop these programs from running</em>
list. However, it does filter out the path from incoming command lines. For example, if the entry in
<em>Stop these programs from running</em> is <strong>wscript.exe  C:\WINDOWS\SAMPLES\WSH\NETWORK.VBS</strong>,
and the incoming command line is <strong>D:\WIN2000\System32\WScript.exe "C:\WINDOWS\SAMPLES\WSH\NETWORK.VBS"</strong>, 
Scrip 192 will not stop this process from running.</p>

<p>This simply means that you should avoid entering the full path of both the executable and any command line arguments 
when making entries in the <em>Stop these programs from running</em> list.</p>

<P>Scrip 192 requires that any executable in the <em>Stop these programs from running</em> list should be entered
with its extension. For example, you should enter <strong>wscrip.exe</strong>, not <strong>wscript</strong>. This also means
that Scrip 192 will not terminate the execution of a command line where the executable is entered without its extent.</p>

<h3>Parameters common to <em>stop list</em> and <em>run list</em> modes of operation</h3>


<h4>Display a message when a program is terminated</h4>

<p>If you enable this option upon termination of a program you don't want end-users to run, or an attempt to run
a program end-users are not allowed to run, Scrip 192 will display a dialog box titled <em>Executable control</em> 
with either a default message or a custom message (see below).</p>

<p>If no custom text is entered in the <em>Custom message text</em> box, Scrip 192 will display the following
default message:

<p><strong>Execution of the following program(s) was terminated:</strong></p>

<P>followed by the name(s) of the program(s) whose execution was terminated or prevented.</P>


<h4>Custom message text</h4>

<p>Here you enter the optional content of the message you want displayed in the <em>Custom message text</em> box. </p>
