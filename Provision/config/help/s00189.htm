<h3>Scrip 189 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip disabled</li>
<li><em>File types to block and files to substitute</em> list empty</li>
</ul>

<h4>File types to block and files to substitute</h4>

<p>On systems it is enabled on, Scrip 189 detects and removes the specific files and types of files
entered in the <em>File types to block and files to substitute</em> list
when a user attempts to download them.</p>

<p>Entries in the <em>File types to block and files to substitute</em> list
have the follwing format:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name of file or file mask whose download you want Scrip 189 to block followed by a comma</li>
<li>Name of file you want Scrip 189 to substitute blocked file with</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific files are identified by their complete name including extension.
MS-DOS wild card characters (?, *) are used to define the files masks for the types of files whose download you want to
block. For example, *.vbs, *.com, pref?????.*.</p>

<p>When you want the Scrip to detect and block the downloading of more than one type of file,
or more than one specific
file, each file type or specific file's name should be entered on a separate line in
the <em>File types to block and files to substitute</em> list.</p>



<p>Files that are removed are replaced with the file whose name is entered (without path) on the same line as
the name of the
specific file or file type whose download is prevented. Scrip 189 looks for this file in the Automated Support
Infrastructure (ASI) client directory (<drive>:\Program Files\HandsFree\Client).</p>

<p>If no such file name is entered, the file whose download was prevented is replaced with a file whose content
is zeros.</p>

<p><strong>It's important to note that Scrip 189 only replaces the content of the file whose download was blocked,
not its name. Unless the end-user is informed on a timely basis that the file download filtering is enabled,
this can lead to repeated attempts to download a file, and
consequent frustration on the part of the end-user.</strong></p>

<p>To minimize the potential for this to happen, we have included in the ASI client directory a
small program called block.exe (also in zipped form, block.zip) that when executed informs the end user
about the file download blocking policy in effect with the following statement:<br><br>
<em>"Sorry, per company policy download of this file type is not allowed.
Please contact your system administrator with any questions. Thank you."</em><br><br>
<p>You can use block.exe, or block.zip as the files that replace blocked files when
blocking files of types .exe, or .zip, respectively.</p>

<p>You should also be aware that depending on the browser used by the end-user to attempt to download a file, and
the type of replacement file you selected (e.g. .gif), a blocked file download attempt may result in
the display of the replacement file's content on the end-user system's screen.</p>

<p>Browser caching affects use of Scrip 189 in another way. If you disable the Scrip and a user attempts to download
a file whose download had been previously blocked by Scrip 189, the download operation will fail again until
the browser cache is cleared either explicitly by the user, or it's recycled.</p>

<p>This happens because Scrip 189 gives the file it uses to substitute a file being blocked the same name.
During the first attempt to download the file, when Scrip 189 was enabled, the browser
cached the file used by Scrip 189 to substitute the file whose download was blocked.
Even if the Scrip is disabled, subsequent attempts will fail until the browser cache is cleared.</p>
