</UL>
<H4>Disks to defragment</H4>
<P>You can change the value of this parameter by simply deleting the
default value and entering the drive letter of each drive you want
defragmented followed by a colon, e.g. <STRONG>c:</STRONG>. The entry
for each drive you want defragmented should be on a separate line.</P>
<H4>Command Line Parameters</H4>
<P>By default, Scrip 19 executes disk defragmenter in unattended
mode. It does not stop and display confirmation messages (/noprompt
command line parameter). All files and free space on all local,
non-removable drives are defragmented (/all, /f command line
parameters).</P>
<P>In order to defragment drives selectively, the drive selection
parameter can be changed from /all to <STRONG>[drive]:</STRONG> where
<STRONG>[drive]</STRONG> should be replaced with the drive letter of
each logical drive you want to have defragmented.</P>
<P>When more than one drive letter is used, each <STRONG>[drive]:</STRONG>
should be entered on a separate line.</P>
<P>Scrip 19 does not allow the addition of any Defragmenter command
line parameters to the execution of Defragmenter except for drive
selection.</P>
<P>The /noprompt and /f parameters cannot be deleted.</P>
<H4>Maximum run time (minutes)</H4>
<P>This parameter lets you control the maximum amount of time
defragmenter will be allowed to run. When setting a value keep in
mind that if a drive or drive(s) have not been defragmented for a
long time, disk defragmentation will take a significant amount of
time. If the disk drives are large and close to capacity, it could
take several hours.</P>
<P>In setting a value for this parameter you should also keep in mind
other Scrips that may be scheduled to run during the same time of day
to avoid conflict.</P>
<H4>Names of processes to shutdown</H4>
<P>The <EM>Names of processes to shutdown</EM> parameter can be used
to list all the processes you would like Scrip 19 to shut down in an
orderly fashion before starting disk defragmentation. The full name
of each process to be terminated, including extension, should be
entered on a separate line. Full location paths are not required.</P>
<P>This configuration entry should be used with care. For example,
you should not use either of the masks <STRONG>*</STRONG> or <STRONG>*.*</STRONG>
because they would have the effect of terminating both the ASI Client
and other processes (e.g. explorer.exe) that are necessary for
executing Scrip 19 (the ASI Client), and keep the system running
(explorer.exe).</P>
<P>One or more of the processes running at the time disk
defragmentation is scheduled to start that need to be shut down may
require user action or response in order to be terminated. For
example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Open network connections that in
	order to be closed require user approval 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Applications like Microsoft Word
	that require a user to save or close without saving files that have
	been changed and not saved at the time Word is terminated, or 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Information agents like Intuit Quickbooks' qbdagent.exe. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Scrip 19 handles these situations automatically. You can control
process shut-down with the <EM>Max number of seconds to wait for the
process to close</EM> and <EM>Max number of dialogs to close</EM> 
</P>
<H4>Max number of seconds to wait for the process to close</H4>
<P>This parameter lets you control how long Scrip 19 should wait
before shutting down each process that was active at the time disk
defragmentation was scheduled to start.</P>
<H4>Max number of dialogs to close</H4>
<P>In many instances, requests for user action communicated via
dialog boxes are part of process shut down sequences. Scrip 19
handles these requests automatically.</P>
<P>Whenever a dialog box requesting user input appears during a
process' shut down sequence, Scrip 19 closes it taking the default
action. For example, if the dialog box requests whether a file should
be saved or not, and the default response is <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>,
Scrip 19 will automatically click on the <STRONG>Yes</STRONG> button.</P>
<H4>Names of processes to startup</H4>
<P>This parameter can be used to list all the processes you would
like Scrip 19 to start up after disk defragmentation is completed.
The full location path and name of each process to be started,
including extension, should be entered on a separate line.</P>
<H4>Reboot system</H4>
<P>When this parameter is enabled, Scrip 19 will restart the system
after disk dfragmentation is completed.</P>
<P>Parameters <EM>Names of processes to startup</EM> and <EM>Reboot
system</EM> are independent of each other. If you want to restart the
system after disk defragmentation is completed, Scrip 19 will ignore
the list of processes to start up after disk defragmentation is
completed. If you don't want to restart the system after disk
defragmentation is completed, then Scrip 19 will look for process(es)
to start once disk defragmentation is completed.</P>
<H4>Run disk defragmenter (MS Windows 9x and Me) now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 19 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 19, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
