<H4>Update from other accessible machines</H4>
<P>When you enabled the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM>
configuration parameter, Scrip 12 will replace the Norton Anti Virus
virus definitions on each system where this option is enabled with
the newest virus definitions found on the sub-net where the system is
installed. If none of the other virus definition update functions are
enabled, Scrip 12 ends execution after this operation is completed.</P>
<H4>Update from on-site server</H4>
<P>An <EM>on-site server</EM> is a system where Norton Anti Virus and
Symantec LiveUpdate are installed, and that is known to consistently
have up-to-date virus definitions. For example this could be one
system (or more than one) where the virus definitions are updated
manually to ensure that the update is successful.</P>
<P>If the <EM>Update from on-site server</EM> configuration parameter
is enabled, Scrip 12 will look for newer virus definitions at the
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> list.
If the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM> configuration
parameter is enabled searching for newer virus definitions at
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM>
configuration parameter occurs after Scrip 12 has completed the
search for newer virus definitions on other accessible systems on the
sub-net.</P>
<H4>Update from vendor</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Update from vendor</EM> configuration parameter is
enabled, Scrip 12 will look for newer virus definitions from
Symantec's site using Symantec's LiveUpdate software. If Scrip 12
cannot find Symantec's LiveUpdate software, it logs this fact, and
ends execution. If either <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM>
or <EM>Update from on-site server</EM>, configuration parameters, or
both, are enabled, Scrip 12 will look for newer virus definitions
from Symantec's site only if it was not successful finding newer
virus definitions using the other two options.</P>
<H4>On-site server locations</H4>
<P>Each entry in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> configuration
parameter contains the full path for an on-site server. Each entry
should be on a separate line.</P>
<H4>Date of latest definitions</H4>
<P><STRONG>The <EM>Date of latest definitions</EM> parameter is
displayed for information only. It should not be modified under any
circumstances. If it were to be modified, Scrip 12 would not function
properly.</STRONG></P>
<P>The purpose of the <EM>Date of latest definitions</EM>
configuration parameter is to keep a running list of the virus
definition dates for all systems running Norton Anti Virus. As a
result, when a machine is searching for updates on other systems on
the sub-net, it simply accesses this list. It does not have to
contact every machine on the subnet. This minimizes local network
traffic and bandwidth usage. From the list's entries a system finds
out the dates of virus definitions available on the sub-net, and
which system(s) has/have them.</P>
<P>The format of <EM>Date of latest definitions</EM> configuration
parameter entries is as follows: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Day, Month Day, Hour:Minute:Second, Seconds since 1970</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Wednesday, November 17, 2004 00:00:00, 1100649600</P>
</UL>
<H4>Machines to report virus definition dates</H4>
<P>You use the <EM>Machines to report virus definition dates</EM>
configuration parameter to control which systems should report virus
definition dates on the systems on the sub-net. If you want all
systems on a sub-net to report virus definition dates, all you need
to enter in the list is a *. An empty list is equivalent to this
function being disabled.</P>
<H4>Maximum age of virus definitions in days</H4>
<P>When the date of the Norton Anti Virus virus definition database
files is older than the current date by the number of days specified
by the <EM>Maximum age of virus definitions in days</EM>
configuration parameter, or more, Scrip 12 will post this information
on the ASI server.</P>
<H4>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</EM>
configuration parameter helps minimize the likelihood that if only
one system has the latest (or newer) virus definitions, this system
not be flooded with requests for the newer virus definitions from
other systems. When the ASI client on a system successfully retrieves
virus definitions from the vendor's site, the <EM>Maximum random
delay before update (minutes)</EM> configuration parameter ensures
that requests for the newer virus definitions from other systems do
not occur simultaneously, maxmimizing the probability the the system
be able to service at least one of the requests. Once that happens,
the number of systems that can provide the newer virus definitions is
automatically doubled (at least), ensuring that all requests will be
fulfilled.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Maximum retries for obtaining local
updates</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">As its name suggests, the <I>Maximum
retries for obtaining local updates</I> configuration parameter lets
you set the number of times Scrip 12 will attempt to obtain the
newest virus definitions available on the sub-net from other systems
on the sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>3</B>.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Local update retry delay (minutes)</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">With the <I>Local update retry delay
(minutes)</I> configuration parameter, you set the time interval
between attempts Scrip 12 will make to obtain the newest virus
definitions available on the sub-net from other systems on the
sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>60 </B>minutes.</P>
<H4>Report when anti-virus product is not installed</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report when anti-virus product is not
installed</I> configuration parameter, on systems where Norton Anti
Virus is not installed Scrip 12 will post a log on the ASI server
with this information. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">You might want to use this
configuration parameter periodically to find out which systems at a
site do not have anti virus software installed. In this way, you
would be able to intervene pro-actively and add anti virus protection
to unprotected systems before a virus infects them.</P>
<H4>Command line parameters</H4>
<P>Scrip 12 runs in silent mode with the -s parameter in the command
line. The -s parameter cannot be deleted.</P>
<H4>Run Symantec LiveUpdate now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 12 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 12, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
