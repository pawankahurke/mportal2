<H4>Rules 
</H4>
<P>The <EM>Rules</EM> parameter is a list of named network packet
filtering rules, each on a separate line. The format of an entry in
the <EM>Rules</EM> parameter is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The name of the rule, followed by
	a comma with no spaces,

	</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&lt;property name&gt;=&lt;property value&gt;</PRE>
</UL>
<P>Rules use filters to accept or deny network packets. Scrip 228
network packet filtering rules filter network packets based on:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Address</P>
	<LI><P>Protocol, and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Interface</P>
</UL>
<P>The Scrip also includes some convenient extensions to interface
classification, and implicitly includes connection state in TCP and
UDP filtering.</P>
<P>As described above, you assign each property in a rule a value
that defines the match for that property. If a property is specified,
then packets are tested against the value you specify for that
property. A match will occur, and the action specified in the <I>Action</I>
property taken, if the packet information matches the value specified
for the property. If the property is not specified, then any packet
will match that particular property. 
</P>
<P>Scrip 228 supports the following rule properties and corresponding
values:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Source address: the property name is <EM>srcadr</EM> and the
	value is an address/mask using the dot-slash notation.
	Alternatively, an address can be a domain name (see the notes below
	on this). For example: 
	</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">    srcadr=192.168.1.0/24</PRE>
	<LI><P>Destination address: the property name is <EM>dstadr</EM> and

	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">    proto=tcp
    proto=tcp+udp</PRE><P>
	If you leave the protocol out of a rule specification, the rule

	<LI><P>Source port: the property name is <EM><EM>srcprt</EM></EM>

	The actual result of a <EM>deny</EM> action is simply to drop the

</OL>
<P>A <EM>Rules</EM> parameter entry is then made up of a series of
properties concatenated together, separated by commas with no spaces.
For example: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">    srcadr=192.168.1.0/24,proto=tcp,act=allow</PRE><P>
Please note that a rule does not have a value, or even a placeholder
for all properties, as shown in the example above.</P>
<H5>Built-in rules</H5>
<P>The ASI client adds some <EM>built-in</EM> rules at the beginning
of every chain so that even if you make a mistake in the rules, the
ASI client will still be able to reach other ASI clients and also
reach the ASI server. This allows you to correct your mistake without
requiring physical access to the systems involved.</P>
<P>The rules automatically added by the ASI client (built-in) are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>builtin_hfn,proto=tcp+udp,dstprt=2721,act=allow</P>
	<LI><P>builtin_hfn_server,proto=tcp,dstprt=443,act=allow</P>
	<LI><P>builtin_dns,proto=udp,dstprt=53,act=allow</P>
</UL>
<P>The ASI client adds the following rules to the start of every rule
chain used in a <EM>send</EM></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>builtin_hfn,builtin_hfn_server,builtin_dns</P>
</UL>
<P>and adds the following rules to the start of every rule chain used
in a <EM>receive</EM></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>builtin_hfn</P>
</UL>
<P>The ASI client dynamically adjusts the port <EM>2721</EM> in the
&quot;builtin_hfn&quot; rule and the port <EM>443</EM> in the
<EM>builtin_hfn_server</EM> rule, based on the actual ports that are
used.</P>
<P>The inter-client port (2721) will always be correct since it only
set once at ASI client startup. However, the server port (443) can be
changed dynamically in the settings for Scrip 43, by either changing
the server URL or by changing the proxy configuration information. If
you change this port with the firewall running, then the built-in
rules will be temporarily incorrect and the client may lose contact
with the server. If you need to change the port number used by the
server, you should either disable the firewall before the change and
re-enable it after the change, or else add your own rule to allow
contact on the new port before the change, then remove it after the
change.</P>
<P>Scrip 228 has two other built-in rules:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>allow,act=allow</P>
	<LI><P>deny,act=deny</P>
</UL>
<P>Scrip 228 does not automatically add these rules to rule chains
you define. You have to add them to any rule chain where you want to
use them. <B>We strongly advise you to add either the allow, or deny
rule, as appropriate, to the end of each chain of rules you define.
In this way you will avoid the situation where when no rule in a
chain applies, Scrip 228 will take the default action.</B></P>
<H4>Rule chains</H4>
<P>The <EM>Rule chains</EM> parameter is a list of named network
packet filtering chains, each on a separate line. The format of an
entry in the <EM>Rule chains</EM> parameter is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The name of the chain, followed by
	a comma with no spaces</P>
	<LI><P>The names of the network packet filtering rules that define
	the chain, separated by commas with no spaces</P>
</UL>
<P>In evaluating a chain, Scrip 228 takes the action specified by the
first rule in the chain that is matched by a packet. If no action is
specified in the matching rule, or no rules match, then the action
specified in the <EM>Default action</EM> parameter is taken.</P>
<P>When filtering TCP packets, Scrip 228 maintains connection state
and always allows packets (in either direction) that are part of an
established connection. The network packet filtering rules only apply
to TCP packets that are attempting to establish a new connection.</P>
<P>When filtering UDP packets, Scrip 228 maintains information about
UDP traffic and always allows packets (in either direction) that are
going between the same endpoints (same address and port numbers) as a
packet that was previously allowed. This &quot;UDP connection&quot;
times out after a certain time period. The network packet filtering
rules apply to any UDP packet that is not between the same endpoints
as a previously allowed packet within the timeout period.</P>
<H4>Adapter classes</H4>
<P>The final step in configuring Scrip s228 is the matching of
adapter classes with rule chains.</P>
<P>Scrip 228 applies the network packet filtering rules in a chain to
selected network adapters. This is done via the <EM>Adapter classes</EM>
parameter by associating a chain of network packet filtering rules to
one or more of the pre-defined adapter classes.</P>
<P>The <EM>Adapter classes</EM> parameter consists of a list of
adapter classes, each on a separate line. The format of an entry in
the <EM>Adapter classes</EM> parameter is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The name of the adapter class,
	followed by a comma with no spaces</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The name of the rule chain to
	apply for <EM>send operations</EM>, followed by a comma with no
	spaces</P>
	<LI><P>The name of the chain to apply for <EM>receive</EM>
	operations</P>
</UL>
<P>Entries in the <EM>Adapter classes</EM> parameter should be
organized by class from most general to most specific, so the last
item in the list that applies to a particular adapter specify the
chains used for filtering packets on that adapter.</P>
<P>The exception to the above rule is the <EM>Default</EM> adapter
class. It can be located anywhere in the list of adapter classes in
the <EM>Adapter classes</EM> parameter. Scrip 228 will apply it last,
after all other adapter classes defined in the parameter have been
applied, regardless of its location in the list of adapter classes.</P>
<P>The adapter classes you can use in the <EM>Adapter classes</EM>
parameter are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">wired: an adapter that has a
	physical connection to a LAN.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">wireless: a wireless network
	adapter.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dialup: a dial-up connection
	through a modem.</P>
	<LI><P>default: any adapter not chosen by another class.</P>
</UL>
<H4>Default action</H4>
<P>The <EM>Default action</EM> parameter specifies the default action
for a network packet filtering rule if no action is specified. It
also specifies the default action for a chain if no rule in the chain
applies. <EM>Default action</EM> can have two values, either the word
<STRONG>allow</STRONG> or the word <STRONG>deny</STRONG> The default
value is <STRONG>deny</STRONG>.</P>
<P><B>Please note that if Scrip 228 finds an error in rules, chains,
or adapter classes, it will report the error, and will not filter any
packets.</B></P>
<H4>Logging</H4>
<P>When enabled, Scrip 228 tracks the number of times each network
packet filtering rule is applied on each adapter and logs these
counts on the ASI server periodically, at the time indicated in the
Schedule parameter. After Scrip 228 posts the counts on the ASI
server, it resets each counter to zero.</P>
<P>Logging is controlled by the value of the <EM>Allow threshold</EM>
parameter and the <EM>Deny threshold</EM> parameter. Each network
packet filtering rule performs either an <STRONG>allow</STRONG> or a
<STRONG>deny</STRONG> <EM>action</EM>. The thresholds control whether
application of a rule is reported. The number of times a rule is
applied will be reported only if it is greater than the corresponding
threshold at the time logs are scheduled to be posted. If no count
meets the threshold requirement, then no log is generated.</P>
<P>Scrip 228 also lets you trigger the logging function on demand by
clicking on the Execute button to the right of the Log network packet
filtering statistics now label. However, when a log is generated as a
result of clicking on the Execute button, a log with all packet
counts equal to zero will be generated even if no count meets the
threshold requirement.</P>
<P>Scrip 228 logs network packet filtering statistics by adapter
class. Within each adapter class, network packet filtering counts are
given for each rule in the chain applied to the adapter class.</P>
<P>Note that Scrip 228 will log any configuration change, and will
post a log with its initial configuration the first time it is
enabled.</P>
<H5>Logging enabled</H5>
<P>The <EM>Logging enabled</EM> parameter lets you turn logging of
network packet filtering statistics on one, some, or all systems at a
site.</P>
<H5>Allow threshold</H5>
<P>The <EM>Allow threshold</EM> parameter lets you set the threshold
above which application of rules with an <EM>action</EM> property
having a value of <STRONG>allow</STRONG> is logged. The number of
times a rule with an <STRONG>allow</STRONG> <EM>action</EM> property
is applied has to be greater than or equal to the threshold in order
for it to be logged. The default value of <EM>Allow threshold</EM> is
<STRONG>-1</STRONG>, indicating that application of rules with an
<STRONG>allow</STRONG> <EM>action</EM> property is never logged.</P>
<H5>Deny threshold</H5>
<P>The <EM>Deny threshold</EM> parameter lets you set the threshold
above which application of rules with an <EM>action</EM> property
having a value of <STRONG>deny</STRONG> is logged. The number of
times a rule with a <STRONG>deny</STRONG> <EM>action</EM> property is
applied has to be greater than or equal to the threshold in order for
it to be logged. The default value of <EM>Deny threshold</EM> is <STRONG>1</STRONG>,
indicating that any application of rules with a <STRONG>deny</STRONG>
<EM>action</EM> property will be logged, but no log will be generated
when there are no <STRONG>deny</STRONG> operations.</P>
<H4>Log network packet filtering statistics now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run the Scrip 228
network packet filtering statistics reporting function on demand. The
<EM>Execute</EM> button can be used to execute the Scrip on the local
system or on all systems where the ASI client is running. When you
click on the <EM>Execute</EM> button to the right of the Log network
packet filtering statistics now label, the Scrip's network packet
filtering statistics reporting function runs immediately.</P>
<H4>Scrip 228 default configuration</H4>
<P>Scrip 228 is configured with default rules, rule chains and
adapter classes to make it possible for you to use it productively
with a minimum of configuration changes (in fact none unless you want
to make any changes). All you need to do is enable it. Below, you
will find a listing of Scrip 228's default configuration:</P>
<H5>Rules</H5>
<PRE>smb,srcnet=local,dstprt=137+138+139,act=allow
passiveftp,proto=tcp,srcprt=20,act=allow
allicmp,proto=icmp,act=allow
noremoteping,srcnet=remote,proto=icmp,icmp=8,act=deny
noping,proto=icmp,icmp=8,act=deny
dhcp,proto=udp,srcprt=67,dstprt=68,act=allow</PRE><H5>
Rule chains</H5>
<PRE>trustrecv,smb,passiveftp,noremoteping,allicmp,dhcp,deny
trustsend,allow
notrustrecv,passiveftp,noping,allicmp,dhcp,deny</PRE><H5>
Adapter classes</H5>
<PRE>wireless,trustsend,notrustrecv
dialup,trustsend,notrustrecv
wired,trustsend,trustrecv
default,trustsend,notrustrecv</PRE><P>
In the above default configuration, wireless and dial-up connections
are <EM>untrusted</EM>, and other connections are <EM>trusted</EM>.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that Scrip 228 inserts the built-in rules described
in the <I>Built-in rules</I> section at the beginning of each of the
rule chains in the default configuration.</P>
<P>All adapter class connections allow any outgoing traffic.</P>
<P>Trusted connections allow incoming traffic (both UDP and TCP) on
the three ports that are used for NETBIOS; this allows Microsoft
Windows Networking to operate. Trusted connections also allow
incoming traffic (both UDP and TCP) on port 2721 which allows the ASI
client to operate. Trusted connections allow ICMP <EM>ping</EM>
requests from local addresses, so that <EM>ping</EM> will work
locally.</P>
<P>Untrusted connections do not allow NetBIOS traffic, ASI client
traffic, or ICMP ping packets in. However, they do have to allow
other ICMP traffic in. Also, any incoming traffic that is part of a
TCP connection that was initiated from a system itself will be
allowed.</P>
<P>the <I>passiveftp</I> rule is only used in receive chains. It
allows connections from anywhere when the source port is 20. This
makes it possible for data connections from a passive FTP server to
work correctly.</P>
<P>Please note that you can delete the <I>dhcp</I> rule from the
<I>trustrecv</I> and <I>notrustrecv</I> rule chains if you do not use
DHCP.</P>
<H4>Notes on specifying addresses</H4>
<P>When no address size is specified in the value of the <EM>Source
address</EM> and <EM>Destination address</EM>, properties, <STRONG>/32</STRONG>
is assumed. This means that an address that is specified as an IP
address only is treated as a fully-specified address, not a network
address.</P>
<P>Scrip 228 allows specifying addresses using domain names as a
convenience. However, there are a few things to be aware of when
using this feature:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>It opens up the possibility that the network packet filtering
	function could be compromised by causing the name to resolve to an
	incorrect address (DNS spoofing).</P>
	<LI><P>It may not work well with dynamic IP addresses. Internally,
	the address is maintained as an IP address, and is only updated when
	the ASI client first starts, and thereafter when the schedule runs.</P>
	<LI><P>An address that is specified with a domain name always
	represents a fully specified address, not a network. In other words,
	there is an implicit netmask of <STRONG>255.255.255.255</STRONG> for
	addresses specified with a domain name.</P>
</UL>
<H4>Notes on locality of connections</H4>
<P>In checking an address to see whether it is <STRONG>local</STRONG>
or <STRONG>remote</STRONG>, Scrip 228 currently uses the ARP cache.
It watches both outgoing and incoming ARP packets, and remembers all
IP addresses with MAC address resolutions as being <STRONG>local</STRONG>.
Every other IP address is classified as <STRONG>remote</STRONG>.</P>
<P>This can fail in one circumstance: If the ARP resolution for a
certain IP address happened at a time when the ASI network driver was
not running. However, since there is no timeout in the ASI network
driver cache, and the ARP timeout is relatively short for most
networks, this shouldn't be a problem. The only time this event might
occur is shortly after the ASI client restarts.</P>
<P>Since there is no timeout in the ASI network driver cache, it does
mean that we may have <EM>stale</EM> IP addresses recorded as <STRONG>local</STRONG>.
However, since they were local at one time, this is unlikely to cause
any kind of problem.</P>
<P>You should be aware that this does make Scrip 228 more vulnerable
to an attack by a spoofed ARP packet. However, this kind of attack is
difficult to implement since ARP packets cannot be routed, so at this
point in time we have decided not to address this issue.</P>
<H4>Current limitations</H4>
<P>The passiveftp rule allows an incoming TCP connection to any port,
as long as the source port is 20. This means that an attacker could
exploit any TCP vulnerability by always using a source port of 20.
There is no convenient restriction for this, due to the way that
passive FTP works. One way to protect against this vulnerability is
to disallow passive mode FTP by removing the passiveftp rule from the
chains, and require the use of active mode FTP only.</P>
<P>On systems running the Microsoft Windows NT4 operating system,
traffic through a dialup connection (i.e. via modem) is not currently
filtered by the ASI network driver. Rules intended for modem traffic
will not have any effect. We will address this situation in the
future. In most circumstances, this should not be a major issue since
NT4 is typically used on servers that are more likely to be connected
to the network via hardwired LAN connections.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>

<P>The <EM>Minutes</EM>, <EM>Hours</EM>, <EM>Day of the Month</EM>,
<EM>Month</EM>, and <EM>Day of the Week</EM> fields can have multiple
values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</P>
<P>For example, a <STRONG>1,3,5</STRONG> entry for the <EM>Minutes</EM>
parameter would mean that a Scrip would be executed at minutes 1, 3,
and 5.</P>
<P>A <STRONG>10-14</STRONG> entry for the <EM>Hours</EM> parameter
would mean that a Scrip would be executed hourly starting at 10 AM
and ending at 2 PM.</P>
<P>Multiple value and range entries can be used together, separated
by commas. For example, you could have an entry for the <EM>Hours</EM>
parameter as follows:</P>
<P><B>3,8-18,23</B></P>
