</UL>
<H4>Site</H4>
<P><EM>Site</EM> contains the name of the site used for all ASI logs
posted and activties performed by the ASI client at a site.</P>
<P>Please note that the first time an ASI client from the site
contacts the ASI event management facility on the ASI server, it will
look for an existing site name that matches the one contained in
<EM>Site</EM>. If it does not find one, the ASI event management
facility will create a site name that matches the one contained in
<EM>Site</EM>, and will store all event logs using that newly created
site name.</P>
<P>The same sequence of events will occur the first time an ASI
client from the site contacts the ASI asset management and site
management facilities.</P>
<P>We strongly advise against changing the name of a site by changing
the content of the <EM>Site</EM> parameter in Scrip 43 because it
would be difficult for you to uniformity of site name particularly
where systems belonging to a site are distributed across multiple
local networks over a widely distributed area, or simply consist of
remotely connected and/or mobile systems.</P>
<P>Additional complexity comes from having to make sure that when you
change the value of the <EM>Site</EM> parameter, it is set to <STRONG>global</STRONG>,
or <STRONG>local</STRONG>, as needed, otherwise you would end up with
systems reporting incorrect site information.</P>
<P>If you want to change the name of a site, the easiest and simplest
way to do it is to change the site's name in its profile on the ASI
installation management facility. Doing it this way, avoids all the
issues described in the two paragraphs above.</P>
<H4>User name for configuration authentication</H4>
<P>In the <EM>User name for configuration authentication</EM>
parameter, you enter the user name used to access the ASI client
directly by logging onto it via a browser session from any computer
with direct access to the network where systems where the ASI client
is installed are located.</P>
<P>Please note that the system from which you access the ASI client
does not have to have the client installed.</P>
<H4>Configuration password</H4>
<P>The <I>Configuration password</I> configuration parameter lets you
change the password for directly accessing the ASI client.</P>
<P>Because the <EM>Configuration password</EM> parameter can be
global or local, you can effectively and simply control access to
Scrip configuration conforming to your organization's security and
control policies.</P>
<P>The configuration password is used in conjunction with the user
name entered in the <EM>User name for configuration authentication</EM>
parameter.</P>
<H4>Machine identifier type</H4>
<P><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A>When <EM>Machine identifier type</EM> is
set to <STRONG>0</STRONG>, the ASI client will use a system's NetBIOS
name as the value of field <EM>machine</EM> in event logs sent either
to the server(s) listed in <EM>ASI event management server URL list</EM>,
or via e-mail. If <EM>Machine identifier type</EM> is set to <STRONG>1</STRONG>,
The ASI client will use the <EM>Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)</EM>
it generates upon first-time installation as the value of field
<EM>machine</EM>. When <EM>Machine identifier type</EM> is set to <STRONG>2</STRONG>,
the ASI client will append the value you enter in the <I>Friendly
name when machine identifier type = 2</I> configuration parameter to
the system's NetBIOS name.</P>
<P>By default, <EM>Machine identifier type</EM> is set to <STRONG>0</STRONG>.</P>
<H4>Friendly name when machine identifier type = 2</H4>
<P>The <I>Friendly name when machine identifier type = 2</I>
configuration parameter lets you easily modify the NetBIOS name of a
system by appending a label of your choice right after it. For
example, if the NetBIOS name of a system is <B>node1</B>, and the
value you enter in the <I>Friendly name when machine identifier type
= 2</I> configuration parameter is <B>John Smith</B>, then the name
of the system used by the ASI client and all Scrips, and on the ASI
server will be <B>node1John Smith</B>.</P>
<P>If the value of the <EM>Machine identifier type</EM> is set to <STRONG>2</STRONG>,
and the <I>Friendly name when machine identifier type = 2</I>
configuration parameter is blank, it's as if the value <EM>Machine
identifier type</EM> were set to <STRONG>0</STRONG>. No <I>friendly
name</I> will be appended to a system's Net BIOS name.</P>
<P><B>Because the <I>Friendly name when machine identifier type = 2</I>
configuration parameter can be either local or global, before setting
its value it's very important that you set it to either global or
local, depending on what you want to do.</B></P>
<P>The value of the <I>Friendly name when machine identifier type = 2</I>
configuration parameter is stored in a registry key. Please note that
this parameter does not change or affect in any way a system's
NetBIOS name.</P>
<H4>Proxy URL</H4>
<P>If the site your are configuring the ASI client for uses a proxy
server, you enter the proxy server information in the <EM>Proxy URL</EM>
parameter.</P>
<P>An entry in <EM>Proxy URL</EM> has the following format:</P>
<P><STRONG>http://[user name]:[user password]@[proxy server
name]:[proxy port] </STRONG>
</P>
<P>If user authentication is not required, you do not need <STRONG>[user
name]</STRONG> and <STRONG>[user password]</STRONG>.</P>
<H4>Domain for proxy authenticaton</H4>
<P>If the site you are configuring uses a proxy server that requires
NTLM (NT LAN Manager) authentication, then you may need to enter the
<EM>Domain for proxy authentication</EM> parameter. For example,
Microsoft ISA Proxy requires NTLM authentication by default.</P>
<P>The <EM>Domain for proxy authenticaton</EM> parameter is the NT
domain for which the proxy user name and password specified in the
<EM>Proxy URL</EM> parameter are valid. If you only have one NT
domain, use that domain. If you are using workgroups rather than NT
domains, you do not need to fill in this parameter.</P>
<H4>ASI event management server URL list</H4>
<P>In <EM>ASI event management server URL list</EM> you should enter
the URL of the server(s), ASI clients at the site should log events
to. If you have back-up event management server(s) that ASI clients
can use to log events to in case the primary event management server
is not accessible, <EM>ASI event management server URL list</EM> will
consist of the URLs of the servers each on a different line, with no
blank lines between entries.</P>
<P>Please note that for each server, you will have to enter the full
HTTPS or HTTP command line depending on whether you want the ASI
client-to-server transactions to be SSL encrypted or not. For
example:</P>
<P><STRONG>https://asi.myevents.com</STRONG></P>
<H4>ASI site configuration management server URL list</H4>
<P>In <EM>ASI configuration management server URL list</EM> you
should enter the URL of the server(s), ASI clients at the site should
contact for configuration updates. If you have back-up site
configuration management server(s) that ASI clients can contact for
configuration changes in case the primary site configuration
management server is not accessible, <EM>ASI site configuration
management server URL list</EM> will consist of the URLs of the
servers each on a different line, with no blank lines between
entries.</P>
<P>Please note that for each server, you will have to enter the full
HTTPS or HTTP command line depending on whether you want the ASI
client-to-server transactions to be SSL encrypted or not. For
example:</P>
<P><STRONG>https://asi.myconfigs.com</STRONG></P>
<H4>ASI asset management server URL list</H4>
<P>In <EM>ASI asset management server URL list</EM> you should enter
the URL of the server(s), ASI clients at the site should send asset
logs to. If you have back-up asset management server(s) that ASI
clients can send asset logs to in case the primary asset management
server is not accessible, <EM>ASI asset management server URL list</EM>
will consist of the URLs of the servers each on a different line,
with no blank lines between entries.</P>
<P>Please note that for each server, you will have to enter the full
HTTPS or HTTP command line depending on whether you want the ASI
client-to-server transactions to be SSL encrypted or not. For
example:</P>
<P><STRONG>https://asi.myassets.com</STRONG></P>
<H4>ASI client update management server URL list</H4>
<P>In <EM>ASI software update management server URL list</EM> you
should enter the URL of the server(s), ASI clients at the site should
contact for ASI software updates. If you have back-up software update
management server(s) that ASI clients can contact for ASI software
updates in case the primary software update management server is not
accessible, <EM>ASI software update management server URL list</EM>
will consist of the URLs of the servers each on a different line,
with no blank lines between entries.</P>
<P>Please note that for each server, you will have to enter the full
HTTPS or HTTP command line depending on whether you want the ASI
client-to-server transactions to be SSL encrypted or not. For
example:</P>
<P><STRONG>https://asi.myupdates.com</STRONG></P>
<H4>ASI site Microsoft update management server URL list</H4>
<P>In <EM>ASI Microsoft update management server URL list</EM> you
should enter the URL of the server(s), ASI clients at the site should
contact for Microsoft update management functions. If you have
back-up Microsoft update management server(s) that ASI clients can
contact to perform Microsoft update management functions in case the
primary Microsoft update management server is not accessible, <EM>ASI
site Microsoft update management server URL list</EM> will consist of
the URLs of the servers each on a different line, with no blank lines
between entries.</P>
<P>Please note that for each server, you will have to enter the full
HTTPS or HTTP command line depending on whether you want the ASI
client-to-server transactions to be SSL encrypted or not. For
example:</P>
<P><STRONG>https://asi.myconfigs.com</STRONG></P>
<H4>ASI site provisioning and metering management server URL list</H4>
<P>In <EM>ASI provisioning and metering management server URL list</EM>
you should enter the URL of the server(s), ASI clients at the site
should contact to perform provisioning and metering functions. If you
have back-up provisioning and metering management server(s) that ASI
clients can contact to perform provisioning and metering functions in
case the primary provisioning and metering management server is not
accessible, <EM>ASI site provisioning and metering management server
URL list</EM> will consist of the URLs of the servers each on a
different line, with no blank lines between entries.</P>
<P>Please note that for each server, you will have to enter the full
HTTPS or HTTP command line depending on whether you want the ASI
client-to-server transactions to be SSL encrypted or not. For
example:</P>
<P><STRONG>https://asi.myconfigs.com</STRONG></P>
<H4>Management server fail-over scheme</H4>
<P>You can use the <I>Management server fail-over scheme</I>
configuration parameter to decide which strategy the ASI client
should use when there are multiple entries in any of the management
server URL list configuration parameters. Please note that the
<I>Management server fail-over scheme</I> configuration parameter
applies to ALL management server URL list configuration parameters.</P>
<P>If the <I>Management server fail-over scheme</I> configuration
parameter is set to 1, its default value, the ASI client always tries
to log to the server listed first in the <I>Management server
fail-over scheme</I> configuration parameter. If it is not available,
it will try to log to the second server on the list, and so on, until
it finds a server which is available. If <I>Management server
fail-over scheme</I> is set to 2, the ASI client logs to the last
server it was able to reach.</P>
<H4>Use HTTP/HTTPS for event logging</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Use HTTP/HTTPS for event logging</EM> option is
enabled, the ASI client will send logs to the server(s) listed in <EM>ASI
event management server URL list</EM> via HTTP or HTTPS depending on
the URL entered in <EM>ASI event management server URL list</EM>.</P>
<P><EM>Use HTTP/HTTPS for event logging</EM> is enabled by default.
if both <EM>Use HTTP/HTTPS for event logging</EM> and <EM>Use email
for event logging</EM> are enabled, the former overrides the latter.</P>
<H4>Use email for event logging</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Use email for event logging</EM> option is enabled,
and the <EM>Use HTTP/HTTPS for event logging</EM> option is disabled,
the ASI client will send logs to the e-mail addresse(s) listed in the
<EM>Email address for administration group</EM>, <EM>Email address
for technical support group</EM>, <EM>Email address for engineering
group</EM>, or <EM>Return address for bounced email messages</EM>
parameters, depending on the Scrip that produced the log. <STRONG>Please
note that you do not have the option to change which Scrip send logs
to which e-mail address</STRONG>.</P>
<H4>Site domain for email logging</H4>
<P><EM>Site domain for email logging</EM> is the domain used to
generate the return email addresses when the ASI client sends logs
via e-mail. For example, if the site domain is <STRONG>company.com</STRONG>
and the machine name is <STRONG>nodeN</STRONG>, the return address
would be <STRONG>nodeN@company.com</STRONG>.</P>
<H4>Destination e-mail addresses for e-mail logging</H4>
<P><EM>Email address for administration group</EM>, <EM>Email address
for technical support group</EM>, and <EM>Email address for
engineering group</EM>, are the addresses to which event logs are
sent when the <EM>Use email for event logging</EM> option is enabled.
</P>
<H4>Return address for bounced email messages</H4>
<P>When ASI client logs sent via e-mail do not reach any one of the
addresses entered in the <EM>Email address for administration group</EM>,
<EM>Email address for technical support group</EM>, <EM>Email address
for engineering group</EM>, and <EM>Return address for bounced email
messages</EM> parameters, they will be returned to the e-mail address
you enter in the <EM>Return address for bounced email messages</EM>
parameter.</P>
<H4>SMTP server for email logging</H4>
<P>When sending logs via e-mail, the ASI client will use the SMTP
server whose name or IP address you enter in <EM>SMTP server for
email logging</EM>.</P>
<P>If <EM>SMTP server for email logging</EM> is empty, The ASI client
first tries to retrieve the name of the authoritative mail server for
the domain by using DNS. If that fails, the ASI client tries to use
the sub-net's gateways as mail servers.</P>
<H4>Window hooks enabled</H4>
<P>The <EM>Window hooks enabled</EM> option lets you enable or
disable detection of Microsoft Windows messages. It is enabled by
default and you should disable it only under exceptional
circumstances. When it is disabled, as significant portion of the ASI
client's event detection capabilities would not be operational.</P>
<P>Disabling the <EM>Window hooks enabled</EM> option will affect the
following Scrips:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Scrip 38 will no longer detect

<H4>Enable client access from the network if system firewall is
active</H4>
<P>The <EM>Enable client access from the network if system firewall
is active</EM> configuration parameter applies only to systems
running the Microsoft Windows XP operating system. When the Microsoft
Windows XP native firewall is enabled, enabling the <EM>Enable client
access from the network if system firewall is active</EM>
configuration parameter lets ASI clients continue to be able to
communicate with each other via port 2721.</P>
<H4>Enable Scrip time-out checking</H4>
<P><EM>When the Enable Scrip time-out checking configuration
parameter is enabled, an execution time threshold is set for selected
Scrips. This threshold varies with each Scrip. If one of these
Scrips' execution time exceeds its threshold, the ASI client
restarts.</EM></P>
<H4>Dump failed logging attempts to error log file</H4>
<P>When <EM>Dump failed logging attempts to error log file</EM> is
enabled, The ASI client will write all HTTP/HTTPS errors detected
when sending logs to the ASI server to a log file called <EM>errlog.txt</EM>
that resides in the ASI client directory.</P>
<P>When the ASI client detects the presence of <EM>errlog.txt</EM> in
its directory, it automatically sends it to the ASI server. The
information contained in <EM>errlog.txt</EM> is very helpful in
diagnosing HTTP/HTTPS communication problems. <EM>errlog.txt</EM> is
in plain text format. The data it contains is traceback information
and HTML messages the ASI server generates when an error occurs.</P>
<P>Please note that you should not enabled the <EM>Dump failed
logging attempts to error log file</EM> parameter unless necessary
for diagnosing a problem. Otherwise, any failure to log events to the
ASI server will trigger the dump, even when the failure is not caused
by a problem but to conditions such as a system not being connected
to the Internet by choice.</P>
<H4>Put window text into dialog box event logs</H4>
<P>When <EM>Put dialog box content into dialog box event logs</EM> is
disabled, the ASI client will include only the dialog box title in
the dialog box event logs. This parameter is enabled by default.</P>
<H4>Password for local user interface</H4>
<P>The <I>Password for local user interface</I> configuration
parameter lets you manage and control the password for accessing the

user interface</I> configuration parameter, is empty. In this case,
the ASI client will give access to the local user interface using

<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

<H4>Threshold time for Scrip errors (seconds</H4>
<P>In the <I>Threshold time for Scrip errors (seconds)</I>
configuration parameter you set the interval of time during which the
number of errors that occur during any Scrip's execution cannot
exceed the number you set in the <I>Maximum number of Scrip errors
within threshold time before disabling Scrip</I> configuration
parameter. The value of this configuration parameter applies to all
Scrips. By default it is set to <B>60</B> seconds.</P>
<H4>Scrip timeout when unspecified (seconds</H4>
<P>In the <I>Scrip timeout when unspecified(seconds</I> configuration
parameter you set the interval of time after which execution of a
Scrip (including both queue and execution time) is terminated. When
this happens, a traceback that includes a stack trace for the
timed-out Scrip is generated and uploaded to the ASI server, and the
ASI client will restart. A few Scrips set their own time limit. We
also have a mechanism for Scrips like Scrip 23 (Send Queued Event
Logs) to extend their time limit as long as they know that they are
doing useful work (this is a common technique called a &quot;watchdog
timer&quot;).</P>
<P>Execution of any Scrip that doesn't explicitly set its own time
limit is terminated when the time specified in the <I>Scrip timeout
when unspecified (seconds</I> configuration parameter is exceeded.
The default value for this configuration parameter is set at 12 hours
(43200 seconds). If you set it to zero, then Scrips that don't set
their own time limit will never time out (in other words, zero means
infinite).</P>
<P>The <I>Scrip timeout when unspecified (seconds)</I> configuration
parameter can also be used to terminate the execution of Scrips that
may be stuck in the run queue. If a Scrip is stuck in the run queue
(which you can see using a Scrip dump), then you can set the value of
the <I>Scrip timeout when unspecified (seconds)</I> configuration
parameter to something less than the time the Scrip you want to take
out of the run queue has been in the queue. The next time the ASI
client compares the value of the <I>Scrip timeout when unspecified
(seconds)</I> configuration parameter with the time the Scrip has
been in the queue, it will take the Scrip out of the queue. A
traceback that includes a stack trace for the timed-out Scrip will be
generated and uploaded to the ASI server, and the ASI client will
restart. The stack trace will show us where the Scrip was stuck. Of
course, you usually want to set the default time limit back up once
the client restarts. This entire operation can be performed remotely.</P>
<H4>McAFee VS version override</H4>
<P>If we determine that the current scrip is compatible with a newer

version override</I> configuration parameter equal to the current
major build number for the new release, Scrips 90 (McAfee Virus
Definition Management), and 175 (McAfee VirusScan Execution) will
continue to work without any changes.</P>
<P><B>Please note that the value of the <I>McAfee VS version override</I>
configuration parameter should be changed only by HandsFree Networks

<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal"><FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=3>Site
registration code flush (only change when instructed to do so by
technical support)</FONT></FONT></H4>
<P><B>You should not use the <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><I>Site
registration code flush (only change when instructed to do so by
technical support)</I></FONT> configuration parameter without first
consulting HandsFree Networks. </B>
</P>
<P>Here is how the <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><I>Site
registration code flush (only change when instructed to do so by
technical support)</I></FONT> configuration parameter works. You fill
in the new site registration code and submit the change. This causes
Scrip 43 to run. It copies the site registration code into a special
registry key, clears the <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><I>Site
registration code flush (only change when instructed to do so by
technical support)</I></FONT> configuration parameter, and restarts
the ASI client. When the ASI client starts, it copies that registry
key into the site registration code and flushes the password list.
This causes the ASI client to behave as it always does on a site
registration code change, but prevents it from communicating with
other ASI clients.</P>
<P>the <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><I>Site registration code
flush (only change when instructed to do so by technical support)</I></FONT>
configuration parameter needs to be local-only because it wouldn't
propagate anyway, or at least it wouldn't propagate reliably, because
the ASI client shuts down right after it changes. Also, the whole
point is that this change is supposed to isolate the system where
Scrip 43 is run in this mode from the others at the site, so you
wouldn't want it to propagate.</P>
<P>You can use the <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><I>Site
registration code flush (only change when instructed to do so by
technical support)</I></FONT> configuration parameter to just clear
the password list by setting the new value of the site registration
code to be the same as the current site registration code.</P>
<P>Note that the <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><I>Site registration
code flush (only change when instructed to do so by technical
support)</I></FONT> configuration parameter also affects how the /ID
command line parameter in the ASI client installation executable
works. If you use the /ID command-line parameter when installing the
ASI client to set the site registration code, if the ASI client is
being run on a system where the ASI client is already installed, it
will replace the current site registration code, and flush the
password cache. So, the /ID command line parameter can also be used
to isolate a system from the others. 
</P>
<H4>Generate new HandsFree Client UUID</H4>
<P>Under certain circumstances, you could end up with multiple
systems have the same UUID (unique universal identifier) generated by
the ASI client upon installation. For example, if you include the ASI
client in a standard image, every system where you install that image
will have the same UUID. This causes a number of problems including
degraded ASI server performance. Should it arise, to correct this
situation you can use the <I>Generate new HandsFree Client UUID</I>
function. Clicking on the <I>Generate new HandsFree Client UUID</I>
<B>Execute</B> button will archive and delete a system's current
UUID, and generate a new one.</P>
<H4>Clear configuration database and restart</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <STRONG>Execute</STRONG> button to the right of
the Clear configuration database and restart label will delete the
ASI client and Scrip configuration database, and re-start the ASI
client. Upon restarting, the ASI client will automatically re-create
the ASI client and Scrip configuration database and re-populates it
with configuration values drawn from other copies of the ASI client
and configuration database either on the sub-net or on the ASI
server.</P>
<H4>Send error log file</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <EM>Send error log file</EM> button will
immediately send the Errlog.txt file found in the ASI client
directory to the log server for the local site, or e-mail it to the
designated recipient if e-mail logging is enabled.</P>
<H4>Send mail</H4>
<P>When e-mail logging is set to true, clicking on the <EM>Send mail</EM>
button will immediately sen any e-mail logs found in the email queue
to the designated recipient.</P>
<H4>ASI client uninstall</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <STRONG>Execute</STRONG> button to the right of

accessed.</P>
<H4>ASI client uninstall - silent</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <STRONG>Execute</STRONG> button to the right of
the <EM>ASI client uninstall - silent</EM> label will remove the ASI
client from the system where the Scrip 43 configuration page is being
accessed. This uninstall mode is called silent because no dialog
boxes will appear on the screen during the uninstall process.</P>
