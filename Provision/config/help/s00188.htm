<h3>Scrip 188 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip disabled</li>
<li><em>Attachments to block</em> list empty</li>
</ul>

<h4>Attachments to block</h4>

<p>On systems it is enabled on, Scrip 188 detects and removes specific attachments and types of attachments
entered in the <em>Attachments to block</em> list from any e-mail message received.</p>

<p>Specific files are identified by their complete name including extension. When screening for file types, 
MS-DOS wild card characters (?, *) are used to define the files masks for the types of attachments you want to
delete from incoming e-mail messages. For example, *.vbs, *.com, pref?????.*.</p>


<p>When you want the Scrip to detect and remove more than one type of attachment, or more than one specific
attachment, each attachment type or specific attachment's name should be on a separate line in 
the <em>Attachments to block</em> list.</p>

<p>Attachments that are removed are replaced with a text file with the following content:</p>

<p><strong>The file attached to this message that was
originally named "[file name]" has been removed due
to the filtering policy set up by your system administrator.</strong></p>
