<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

<H4>Impersonation enabled</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Impersonation enabled</EM> parameter is enabled,
using the impersonation user id and password (and domain if
necessary) you entered in <EM>Impersonation Username</EM>,
<EM>Impersonation Password and Confirmation</EM>, and <EM>Impersonation
Domain</EM> parameters in the Scrip 43 configuration page, Scrip 100
can retrieve files that reside on shared resources on other systems
on the network, accessed either as mapped drives(e.g. <STRONG>x:\shared
folder</STRONG>), or using UNC (Universal Naming Convention) syntax
(e.g. <STRONG>\\server\\shared folder</STRONG>).</P>
<H4>Send to default email group</H4>
<P>When you enable the <EM>Send to default email group</EM>
parameter, Scrip 100 will send the file(s) you wish to retrieve to
the e-mail address(es) entered in the <EM>Email address for
administration group </EM>parameter in the Scrip 43 (HandsFree Client
Tools) configuration.</P>
<P>The default value of the <EM>Email address for administration
group </EM>parameter is <STRONG>support@handsfreenetworks.com</STRONG>.
You can change this value easily in the Scrip 43 configuration page.
You can enter multiple e-mail addresses, each separated by a comma,
as the value of parameter<EM> Email address for administration group</EM>.</P>
<P>This will give you the ability to identify one or more email
addresses that can be used globally by any Scrip in one place. When
one or more of these e-mail addresses changes you will have to make
that change in only one place rather than having to modify all the
Scrips that use that e-mail address.</P>
<H4>Email address group definitions</H4>
<P><EM>Email address group definitions</EM> parameter entries have
the following format:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Name of the email group, followed
	by a comma 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Email address(es) separated by commas 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>You can have as many email groups defined as you want with each
group entered on a new line.</P>
<P>Instead of having file(s) sent to an e-mail box, you can have the
ASI client include the file(s)in the log posted by Scrip 100 on your
log server. You do this by entering in your file retrieval command
line <EM>LogServer</EM> as the name of the e-mail group you want
files sent to. Please note that you do not need to create an e-mail
group called <EM>LogServer</EM>. It's built in the ASI client.</P>
<P>If, based on your selection criteria, Scrip 100 retrieves more
than one file, and the <I>Log each file in separate event logs</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, it will generate one log for each
file retrieved.</P>
<P>When sent to e-mail group <EM>LogServer</EM>, the content of the
file retrieved is stored in field <EM>text3</EM> in the event
database on your log server. Please keep in mind that the size of a
file incorporated in a log sent to the log server via the <EM>LogServer</EM>
e-mail group is limited to 64 KBytes.</P>
<H4>Keyword group definitions</H4>
<P><EM>Keyword group definitions</EM> configuration parameter entries
have the following format:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Name of the Keyword group,
	followed by a comma 
	</P>
	<LI><P>keyword(s) separated by commas 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>You can have as many keyword groups defined as you want with each
group entered on a new line.</P>
<H4>File distribution. File location group definitions</H4>
<P>In configuration parameter <EM>File distribution. File location
group definitions</EM> you define each location where you might want
to distribute files.</P>
<P>Entries in <EM>File distribution. File location group definitions</EM>,
called location groups, are on separate lines. Each entry has two
components separated by commas, with no spaces:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first is the name you choose
	to give the location, e.g. <STRONG>hosts</STRONG> 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The second is the actual location on each system where you
	want Scrip 100 to place the file(s) to be distributed, e.g.
	<STRONG>c:\windows</STRONG> 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that a location group can contain multiple locations.
For example,</P>
<P><STRONG>everywhere,c:\windows\application data,c:\program
files\common files,d:\program files\common files</STRONG></P>
<H4>URL group definitions</H4>
<P>In configuration parameter <EM>URL group definitions</EM> you
define each location where you might want to send files from the
system where Scrip 100 runs via a file transfer method different from
e-mail or, because of file size and other constraints, when you may
not want or be able to include the file in an event log posted on the
ASI server.</P>
<P>Currently, we only support file transfer via FTP.</P>
<P>Configuration parameter <EM>URL group definitions</EM> may have
multiple entries, each on a separate line. A configuration parameter
<EM>URL group definitions</EM> entry has two components separated by
commas with no spaces:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first is the name you choose
	to give the URL group, e.g. <STRONG>disasterbackup</STRONG> 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The second is URL for the file transfer, e.g.
	<STRONG><A HREF="ftp://nanoheal.org/">ftp://nanoheal.org/</A> </STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">-
	The URL must not include a file name.</SPAN></STRONG></P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that a location group can contain multiple URLs. For
example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><STRONG>allbackups,ftp://nanoheal.org,ftp://hfndev.com,ftp://corporateink.dnsalias.com</STRONG></P>
</UL>
<P>If you authentication is required in order to access the target
server, you need to embedded it in the URL. For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>securebackup,ftp://upload:abcdefgh@nanoheal.org/</B></P>
</UL>
<H4>File distribution. Overwrite existing file(s)</H4>
<P>When the  <EM>File distribution. Overwrite existing file(s)</EM>
configuration parameter is enabled, the file(s) to be distributed
will overwrite file(s) with the same name.</P>
<H4>Retrieve files by date</H4>
<P>When you enable the <EM>Retrieve files by date</EM> configuration
parameter, Scrip 100 will only retrieve files, matching the mask in
the <EM>File retrieval command lines</EM> configuration parameter,
whose <EM>last modified date</EM> falls in the time interval starting
from the date you enter in the <EM>What is the latest date you want
to retrieve files by? (MM/DD or MM/DD/YY, leave blank if you want
current date)</EM> configuration parameter going backward for a
number of days equal to the value you enter in the <EM>How many days
back from the latest date do you want to retrieve files for?</EM>
Configuration parameter.</P>
<H4>What is the latest date you want to retrieve files by? (MM/DD or
MM/DD/YY, leave blank if you want current date)</H4>
<P>Please note that when you leave the <EM>What is the latest date
you want to retrieve files by? (MM/DD or MM/DD/YY, leave blank if you
want current date)</EM> configuration parameter blank, Scrip 100 will
set the value of this parameter to the date on which it runs (what we
refer to as the current date.</P>
<H4>How many days back from the latest date do you want to retrieve
files for?</H4>
<P>If you set the value of the <EM>How many days back from the latest
date do you want to retrieve files for?</EM> configuration parameter
to <STRONG>0</STRONG>, Scrip 100 will only retrieve files whose <EM>last
modified date</EM> is equal to the date you entered in the <EM>What
is the latest date you want to retrieve files by? (MM/DD or MM/DD/YY,
leave blank if you want current date)</EM> parameter.</P>
<H4>Log each file in separate event logs</H4>
<P>When you select <I>LogServer</I> as the retrieved file
destination, and the <I>Log each file in separate event logs</I>
configuration parameter is enabled, Scrip 100 will post N + 1 event
logs, N, each containing one of the N files it retrieves, and one
containing the Scrip's configuration at the time of execution, and a
report of the actions taken. In each of the N event logs, each
containing a file retrieved:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Field <I>text1</I> will consist
	of: <B>Attachment #X</B> (X = 1 to the number of files retrieved by
	Scrip 100), followed by the string path identifying the file
	contained in the log.</P>
	<LI><P>Field <I>text3</I> will consist of the content of one of the
	files retrieved by Scrip 100 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>File distribution and retrieval command line(s)</H4>
<P>The <EM>File retrieval command line(s)</EM> configuration
parameter contains one or more command lines separated by a carriage
return, or new line feed.</P>
<P>The components of a file retrieval command line are separated by a
comma, with no spaces. Each command line has the following format:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">0 (disable) or 1 (enable) - this
	makes it possible to temporarily stop retrieving certain file(s)
	without deleting the corresponding file retrieval command line from

<P><B>If in a file distribution or retrieval command line you do not
want to enter a value for a parameter located between two parameters
you want to use, you should simply enter a comma with no spaces in

end of a command line, you can ignore them. Please see below for some
examples. </B>
</P>
<P>If you choose to send files retrieved by Scrip 100 only to the
<EM>default email group</EM>, the file retrieval command line should
contain two commas after the entry for the name of the file(s) you
would like the Scrip to retrieve and send. For example:</P>
<UL>

</UL>
<P>In the file retrieval command line, if you don't specify a value
for file deletion or keyword search group, Scrip 100 will use the
default values of 0, and 0, respectively.</P>
<P>Scrip 100 can retrieve and distribute files located on local
network accessible shared resources, FTP, and Web servers (both HTTP
and HTTPS).</P>
<P>Following are examples of file retrieval command lines and how the
