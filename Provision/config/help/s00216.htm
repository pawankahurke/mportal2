<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The print queue problem resolution Scrip monitors print queues on
systems that have an attached printer, or send jobs to be printed on a
network printer. When the Scrip is enabled, it logs a system's printer
configuration every time the ASI client is restarted. The Scrip performs
two main tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor print queues, detect all jobs being printed, and report their status</li>
<li>Detect print jobs that are stuck in the process of being printed,
stop the print queue, remove them, and re-start the print queue enabling
other print jobs, if any, to be printed. Problem resolution is triggered
when the the maximum time that a job can be in the process of being
printed, as set by IT personnel, is exceeded.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Log print queue activity</h4>

<p>When the <em>Log print queue activity</em> parameter is enabled, Scrip 216 detects and reports every job that
is printed from a print queue that is attached to a locally attached printer, or a network printer. </p>

<p>For each print job it detects, Scrip 216 reports the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name of document being printed</li>
<li>Name of system the print job originated from</li>
<li>Name of user logged on at the time print job was sent to printer</li>
<li>Print job processing and completion status</li>
<li>Print job statistics</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated print queue problem resolution enabled</h4>

<p>When the <em>Automated print queue problem resolution enabled</em> option is enabled,
Scrip 216 will perform problem resolution whenever a print job has been in the process of being printed
for an amount of time equal to, or in excess of the amount of time calculated using the values entered in parameters <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em>, <em>Percent time added per print job</em>, <em>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</em>, and <em>Print job sensitivity</em>.</p>

<p>Problem resolution takes place in three phases. Depending on the
severity of the problem, the Scrip's actions escalate as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level I - The Scrip detects the problem and uses spooler functionality
to attempt to remove the job that's causing the problem from the queue
while preserving the other jobs in the queue.

The problem resolution steps carried out are:</li>

<ul>
<li>Shut down of print spooler</li>
<li>Re-start of print spooler</li>
</ul><br>



<li>Level II - If Level I resolution does not resolve the problem, the Scrip
performs the print job removal action directly, while still leaving
untouched the other jobs in the queue.

The problem resolution steps carried out are:</li>

<ul>
<li>Shut down of print spooler</li>
<li>Deletion of job that has been in the process being printed for an amount of time equal to, or in excess of the amount of time calculated using the values entered in parameters <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em>, <em>Percent time added per print job</em>, <em>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</em>, and <em>Print job sensitivity</em>, print queue problem resolution is triggered.</p></li>
<li>Re-start of print spooler</li>
</ul><br>



<li>Level III - If the problem keeps recurring on the same queue, the Scrip
restarts the system where the problem occurs (the problem may be caused
by the print driver and restarting a system resolves most print driver
related problems). Because this action, unlike the others, is very
intrusive, level III problem resolution has to be explicitly enabled by
IT personnel. If it is enabled, before restarting the system, and the
<em>Third level problem resolution user interface enabled</em> option is enabled, the Scrip
will display a dialog box explaining to the user the reason for having
to restart the system and asking the end-user to authorize system
re-start via a yes/no dialog box. If the user clicks on the no button or
ignores the dialog box, the Scrip will not restart the system. If the
printing problem occurs again soon after, the Scrip will once again ask
the user for permission to restart the system.<br>
If the <em>Third level problem resolution user interface enabled</em> option is not enabled, Scrip 216
will perform third level problem resolution directly.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<p>Whenever a print job has been in the process of being printed
for an amount of time equal to, or in excess of the amount of time calculated using the values entered in parameters <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em>, <em>Percent time added per print job</em>, <em>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</em>, and <em>Print job sensitivity</em>, print queue problem resolution is triggered.</p>

<p>For every job sent to a print queue accessible by a system where the ASI client is installed, Scrip 216 calculates the amount of time that should trigger print queue problem resolution for that print job as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, the total amount of time a print job is expected to take is calculated. The first time Scrip 216 performs this calculation it uses the value entered in <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em>. From the second time on, for each printer configured on systems where the ASI client is running, it uses the printing speed value it automatically calculates as it detects the actual time required to print jobs sent to each printer.<br>
The <em>Print job sensitivity</em> parameter is used to minimize the likelihood that any one job, which for unusual reasons could take a very long time to print, might skew printing speed values resulting in an artificially low <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em>. Examples of situations that could lead to skewing of print speed values include:
<ul>
<li>A printer has run out of paper</li>
<li>A paper jam has occurred, or</li>
<li>The door of one of a printer's compartments has been left open</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Then, the total amount of time a print job is expected to take is increased by the percentage entered in <em>Percent time added per print job</em>. For jobs printing documents with a large number of pages this calculation has the greates impact on the print job process time used to trigger print queue problem resolution.</li>

<li>Last, the number of minutes entered in <em>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</em> is added to the total amount of time a print job is expected to take after it was increased by <em>Percent time added per print job</em>. This ensures that the print job process time used to trigger print queue problem resolution for jobs printing very short documents takes into account potential start-up delays minimizing the probability of accidentally triggering print queue problem resolution for small print jobs.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Printing speed (pages per minute)</h4>

<p>In <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em> you enter the typical minimum print speed in your environment. Over time, Scrip 216 will use a printing speed number it calculates based on the actual time taken to print jobs on each printer used by system where the ASI client is installed.</p>


<h4>Percent time added per print job</h4>


<p><em>Percent time added per print job</em> is used to increase the total amount of time a print job is expected to take so as to avoid accidental triggering of print queue problem resolution. This parameter has the greatest effect for jobs with a large number of pages. </p>



<h4>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</h4>


<p><em>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</em> is the amount of time added to the total amount of time a print job is expected to take to account for startup delays. It minimizes the probability of accidentally triggering print queue problem resolution. This time is added in addition to the percentage added using the value in <em>Percent time added per print job</em>. This parameter has the greatest impact on small print jobs where the percentage of time added using <em>Percent time added per print job</em> is negligible due to the short duration of such a print job.</p>



<h4>Print job sensitivity</h4>


<p><em>Print job sensitivity</em> is used to avoid skewing of printing speed values by individual jobs which, for one-time (or infrequently occurring) reasons, may take an unusually long time to print. Examples of situations that could lead to skewing of print speed values include:
<ul>
<li>A printer has run out of paper</li>
<li>A paper jam has occurred, or</li>
<li>The door of one of a printer's compartments has been left open</li>
</ul>








<h4>Third Level problem resolution enabled (system re-start)</h4>

<p>When the <em>Third Level problem resolution enabled (system re-start)</em> parameter is enabled, Scrip 216
automatically initiates third level problem resolution as described above. </p>

<h4>Third level problem resolution user interface enabled</h4>

<p>Enabling the <em>Third level problem resolution user interface enabled</em> option lets end users decide when they
want their system to be restarted in order to attempt to resolve a printing problem. When this option is
not enabled, the Scrip will perform third level problem resolution directly.</p>


<h4>Third level problem resolution custom message enabled</h4>

<p> If the <em>Third level problem resolution custom message enabled</em> option is enabled, Scrip 216 will use
the custom message you specify in the <em>Third Level problem resolution user interface custom message</em>
parameter, rather than use the default message.</p>

<p>The default message is:</p>

<strong>There are problems printing on printer <em>printer name</em> from your system.

In an attempt to resolve these problems, could we restart your system now?</strong>

<h4>Third Level problem resolution user interface custom message</h4>

<p> You use the <em>Third Level problem resolution user interface custom message</em> text box to enter the
custom message you want Scrip 216 to use when asking the user for permission to restart his/her system.</p>
