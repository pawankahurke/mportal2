	per hour at 20 minutes past the hour with a random 3-minute delay.
	This means that Scrip 95 will run from 20 to 23 minutes past the
	hour.</P>
	<LI><P><EM>Report disk space (logical) now</EM> 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The Scrip execution interval can be changed by simply changing the
default schedule.</P>
<P>Please note that when either the <I>Absolute threshold (KB or %)
(e.g. 100000 or 10%)</I> or <I>Change threshold (KB)</I>
configuration parameter is empty, the corresponding function is
disabled.</P>
<H4>Absolute threshold (KB or %) (e.g. 100000 or 10%)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Absolute threshold (KB or %) (e.g. 100000 or 10%)</EM>
configuration parameter is used to alert you about low available
logical disk capacity conditions and effectively regulate the Scrip's
logging activity. 
</P>
<P>The value of the <EM>Absolute threshold (KB or %) (e.g. 100000 or
10%)</EM> configuration parameter can be expressed either in terms of
the absolute amount of available disk capacity expressed in KB (e.g.
100000), or in terms of the % of available disk capacity (e.g. 10% --
note the % appended to the number).</P>
<P>When the value of the <EM>Absolute threshold (KB or %) (e.g.
100000 or 10%)</EM> configuration parameter is expressed in terms of
the % of available disk capacity, it can vary between 100% and 0%.
When it is set to 100%, this means that Scrip 95 will log available
logical disk capacity statistics once per hour (the default Scrip 95
execution schedule). When the value of the <EM>Absolute threshold (KB
or %) (e.g. 100000 or 10%)</EM> configuration parameter is set to X%,
where X is between 0 and 100, this means that Scrip 95 will log
available logical disk capacity statistics once per hour, if its
amount falls below X%. When the value of the <EM>Absolute threshold
(KB or %) (e.g. 100000 or 10%)</EM> configuration parameter is set to
0%, in practice this means that Scrip 95 will log available logical
disk capacity statistics very rarely.</P>
<P>When the value of the <EM>Absolute threshold (KB or %) (e.g.
100000 or 10%)</EM> configuration parameter is expressed in terms of
the absolute amount of available disk capacity expressed in KB, it
can vary between 0 and a number as large as you like. When it is set
to a number greater than the capacity of the largest logical drive on
a system, this means that Scrip 95 will log available logical disk
capacity statistics once per hour (the default Scrip 95 execution
schedule). When the reporting threshold is set to X, where X is
between 0 and the capacity of the largest logical drive on a system,
this means that Scrip 95 will log available logical disk capacity
statistics once per hour, if its amount falls below X. When the value
of the <EM>Absolute threshold (KB or %) (e.g. 100000 or 10%)</EM>
configuration parameter is set to <B>0</B>, in practice this means
that Scrip 95 will log available logical disk capacity statistics
very rarely.</P>
<H4>Change threshold (KB)</H4>
<P>You can use Scrip 95 to warn you when available disk capacity
decreases by the amount specified in the <I>Change threshold (KB)</I>
configuration parameter expressed in number of KBytes.</P>
<P>Every time Scrip 95 runs, for each logical drive on a system, it
finds the largest of the available disk capacity values it has
retained as specified by the value of the <I>Number of samples for
change threshold</I> configuration parameter. It calculates the
decrease from that value to the current available disk capacity. If
the decrease is greater than the value of the <I>Change threshold
(KB)</I> configuration parameter , Scrip 95 will post an event log
onto the ASI server.</P>
<H4>Number of samples for change threshold</H4>
<P>The <I>Number of samples for change threshold</I> configuration
parameter represents the number of available disk capacity
measurements retained by Scrip 95 for each of the logical drives on a
system. 
</P>
<P>Please note that if you increase the value of the <I>Number of
samples for change threshold</I> configuration parameter it will take
some time to accumulate the increased number of samples (an amount of
time equal to the sum of the interval between Scrip 95 executions
necessary to collect a number of samples equal to the increased value
of the <I>Number of samples for change threshold</I> configuration
parameter). The number of samples retained will be smaller than the
increased value of the <I>Number of samples for change threshold</I>
configuration parameter for the amount of time it will take to
collect a number of samples equal to the value of the <I>Number of
samples for change threshold</I> configuration parameter.</P>
<H4>Percentage of free space below which to report for each drive
(used for compatibility)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Percentage of free space below which to report for each
drive</EM> configuration parameter is used to alert the support
provider about low available logical disk capacity conditions and
effectively regulate the Scrip's logging activity. 
</P>
<P>The value of The <EM>Percentage of free space below which to
report for each drive</EM> configuration parameter can vary between
100 and 0. When it is set to 100, in practice this means that for
Scrip 95 will log available logical disk capacity statistics once per
hour (the default Scrip 95 execution schedule). When the reporting
threshold is set to X, where X is between 0 and 100, this means that
Scrip 95 will log available logical disk capacity statistics once per
hour, if its amount falls below X. When the value of The <EM>Percentage
of free space below which to report for each drive</EM> configuration
parameter is set to 0, in practice this means that Scrip 95 will log
available logical disk capacity statistics very rarely.</P>
<H4>Report disk space (logical) now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 95 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 95, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
