<H4>HandsFree client network deployment function restrictions</H4>
<P>At locations where systems are running a version of the Microsoft
Windows XP operating system, the HandsFree client network deployment
function (Scrip 111) works if:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Systems are in a domain</P>
	<LI><P>File and print sharing is enabled</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note the above restrictions apply only to systems running
Microsoft Windows XP.</P>
<P>On sub-nets where systems running Microsoft Windows XP are not in
a domain, in order for the HandsFree Client network deployment
function to work, the following conditions must be met:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Simple file sharing is disabled</P>
	<LI><P>The Microsoft XP firewall is configured to allow file and
	print sharing</P>
</UL>
<P>In addition to the above, In order to use the HandsFree client
network deployment, you will need to provide a user name and password
for an administrative account that works on all systems on the
sub-net. If this is a domain account, you will also need to provide
the domain name for the account. You will also need to check and make
sure that the system you run the HandsFree network deployment
function on is a member of the domain where you want to install the
ASI client.</P>
<H4>HandsFree client network deployment function notes</H4>
<H5>ASI network driver requirement</H5>
<P>In order for the HandsFree Client network deployment function to
work automatically without any user input regarding sub-net IP
address ranges, etc., etc., and in order for it to be able to be a
real-time event driven function working independently of any IP
address ranges, you need to ensure that on the ONE system where you
intend on running the HandsFree Client network deployment function,
the ASI network driver is installed.</P>
<P>This simply means that when installing the ASI client on the
system you want to run the HandsFree Client network deployment
function on, you should <B>not</B> use the <B>/NDS=0</B> command line
option, and after you install the ASI client on the system you should
not remove the ASI network driver.</P>
<H5>Running the HandsFree client network deployment function at
first-time ASI client start-up</H5>
<P>Execution of the HandsFree client network deployment function
(Scrip 111) can be triggered automatically when the ASI client runs
for the first time after it is installed on a system by using the
/DEPLOY=1 option in the ASI client installation executable command
line.</P>
<P>If you used the /DEPLOY=1 command line option when running the ASI
client installation executable, the HandsFree client network
deployment function (Scrip 111) will run on ASI client startup. Upon
(one-time) execution, Scrip 111 generates a dialog box with three
text fields. In these text fields you enter the user name, domain,
and password for a user with administrative rights on all systems
where you want the ASI client installed. Once the requested
information is entered, and you click on the <I>OK</I> button, the
Scrip will initiate ASI client deployment on the sub-net. The dialog
box generated by Scrip 111 persists until you enter the requested
information, and click on the &quot;OK&quot; button, or click on the
&quot;Cancel&quot; button.</P>
<P>If you use the /DEPLOY=0 command line option, the HandsFree client
network deployment function will not run when the ASI client first
runs after it is installed on a system. You can run it later by
directly accessing the Scrip 111 configuration page (not using a
/DEPLOY command line option has the same effect as using /DEPLOY=0).</P>
<H5>Running the HandsFree client network deployment function on
demand</H5>
<P>If you do not run the HandsFree client network deployment function
at ASI client start-up, using the /DEPLOY=1 command line parameter,
you can run it on-demand at a later time. Before you do that, you
will need to enter the necessary administrative user authentication
information in the following Scrip 43 (HandsFree Client Tools)
configuration parameter fields:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Impersonation user name</P>
	<LI><P>Impersonation password</P>
	<LI><P>Impersonation domain 
	</P>
</UL>
<H5>HandsFree client network deployment execution</H5>
<P>After you trigger execution of the HandsFree client network
deployment function (Scrip 111) either by using the /DEPLOY=1 ASI
client installation executable command line option, or on demand by
clicking on the <I>Begin auto deploy</I> Execute button in the Scrip
111 configuration page, the Scrip will run once, execute a network
survey and beginning the ASI client installation on systems in the
sub-net. 
</P>
<P>After the initial execution, Scrip 111 will run every time a new
device is added to the ARP table on the system where Scrip execution
was triggered. 
</P>
<P>If you change the configuration of the network where you ran the
HandsFree network deployment function in a way which you think may
affect the ASI client deployment, you should run the HandsFree client
network deployment function again on demand by clicking on the <I>Begin
auto deploy</I> Execute button in the Scrip 111 configuration page.</P>
<H4>Auto deploy run time (seconds)</H4>
<P>In the <I>Auto deploy run time (seconds)</I> configuration
parameter, you enter the amount of time the Scrip will be in auto
deploy mode, i.e. will automatically install the ASI client on any
system added to the ARP table on the system where Scrip 111 is
running. The default value of the <I>Auto deploy run time</I>
configuration parameter is <B>one day</B>.</P>
<H4>Force installation</H4>
<P>If you enable the Force installation configuration parameter,
Scrip 111 will install the ASI client also on systems where the ASI
client is already installed but not running.</P>
<H4>Run network survey now</H4>
<P>By clicking on the <I>Run network survey now</I> Execute button,
you can run the ASI network deployment survey function at any time.
When you do this, Scrip 111 will post an event log on the ASI server
listing all systems found in the ARP table of the system where the
Scrip ran. The network survey will also identify the devices on which
the ASI client is installed, and those on which it is not installed. 
</P>
<H4>Begin auto deploy 
</H4>
<P>By clicking on the <I>Begin auto deploy</I> Execute button, you
can start the HandsFree client network deployment function in
auto-deploy mode on demand at any time. When you do this, the
HandsFree client network deployment function will run for the period
specified in the <I>Auto deploy run time (seconds)</I> configuration
parameter.</P>
