<H4>Note on Trend Micro anti virus virus definition management</H4>
<P>Unlike other anti virus software products ASI supports, Trend
Micro anti virus software virus definitions dates are not accessible.</P>
<P>Trend Micro anti virus software virus definition updates are
driven strictly by the version number of the definitions. 
</P>
<P>When deciding whether to update virus definition on a system,
Scrip 247 uses the version of the local virus definitions on a
system, and the version of the latest virus definitions available at
a site. 
</P>
<P>Scrip 247 supports three Trend Micro products</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">1. PC-cillin</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">2. OfficeScan server</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">3. OfficeScan client</P>
<P>Both PC-cillin and OfficeScan use the same definitions so they can
update each other using Scrip 247. PC-cillin can be installed on XP,
2K, or 9x. The OfficeScan client can be installed on XP, 2K or 9x but
the server can only be installed on XP or 2K. It is not possible to
install an OfficeScan client without first installing the OfficeScan
server. Once the server is installed a client install executable can
be created on the server or a client can be installed using the web
console interface created by the server install. When a server is set
up, the client also gets installed on the server machine to provide
it with AV protection. 
</P>
<P>The OfficeScan client cannot be updated directly from the vendor;
it can only receive vendor updates from the OfficeScan server. When
Scrip 247 initiates a vendor update on a client it will look to the
server for updates, and when Scrip 247 initiates a vendor update on
the server, it will look to Trend Micro's web site. Therefore, the
update process on the server machine involves two separate processes;
the updating of the server from Trend Micro and the updating of the
server's client from the server. The vendor-to-server update will
update the <I>Version of latest definitions</I> configuration
parameter causing the actual vendor update to propagate to other
clients, including the server's client.</P>
<H4>Update from other accessible machines</H4>
<P>When you enabled the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM>
configuration parameter, Scrip 247 will replace the Trend Micro virus
definitions on each system where this option is enabled with the
newest virus definitions found on the sub-net where the system is
installed. If none of the other virus definition update functions are
enabled, Scrip 247 ends execution after this operation is completed.</P>
<H4>Update from on-site server</H4>
<P>An <EM>on-site server</EM> is a system that is known to have the
Trend Micro anti virus server software. Such a system is configured
to automatically retrieve virus definition updates at regular
intervals. 
</P>
<P>If the <EM>Update from on-site server</EM> configuration parameter
is enabled, Scrip 247 will look for newer virus definitions at the
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> list.
If the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM> option is
enabled searching for newer virus definitions at location(s)
specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> list occurs after
Scrip 247 has completed the search for newer virus definitions on
other accessible systems on the sub-net.</P>
<H4>Update from vendor</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Update from vendor</EM> configuration parameter is
enabled, Scrip 247 trigger a virus definition update cycle on any
system where the Trend Micro anti virus server software is installed.
If Scrip 247 cannot find Trend Micro anti virus software, it logs
this fact, and ends execution. If either <EM>Update from other
accessible machines</EM> or <EM>Update from on-site server</EM>,
configuration parameters, or both, are enabled, Scrip 247 will look
for newer virus definitions from the Trend Micro site only if it was
not successful finding newer virus definitions using the other two
options.</P>
<H4>On-site server locations</H4>
<P>Each entry in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> configuration
parameter contains the netBIOS name or IP address for an on-site
server. Each entry should be on a separate line.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Please note that if neither the </B><EM><B>Update from other
accessible machines</B></EM><B>, or the </B><EM><B>Update from
on-site server</B></EM> <B>configuration parameters are enabled,
Trend Micro virus definitions are not likely to be updated.</B></P>
<H4>Version of latest definitions</H4>
<P><STRONG>The <EM>Version of latest definitions</EM> parameter is
displayed for information only. It should not be modified under any
circumstances. If it were to be modified, Scrip 247 would not
function properly.</STRONG></P>
<P>The purpose of the <EM>Version of latest definitions</EM>
configuration parameter is to track the virus definition version for
all systems running Trend Micro anti virus software. As a result,
when a machine is searching for updates on other systems on the
sub-net, it simply accesses this list. It does not have to contact
every machine on the subnet. This minimizes local network traffic and
bandwidth usage. From the list's entries a system finds out the dates
of virus definitions available on the sub-net, and which system(s)
has/have them.</P>
<P>The format of <EM>Versions of latest definitions</EM>
configuration parameter entries is as follows: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>version number</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>2.741.00</P>
</UL>
<H4>Machines to report virus definition dates</H4>
<P>You use the <EM>Machines to report virus definition dates</EM>
configuration parameter to control which systems should report virus
definition dates on the systems on the sub-net. If you want all
systems on a sub-net to report virus definition dates, all you need
to enter in the list is a *. An empty list is equivalent to this
function being disabled.</P>
<H4>Maximum days since last definition update</H4>
<P>When the date of the Trend Micro anti virus virus definition
database files is older than the current date by the number of days
specified by the <EM>Maximum days since last definitions update</EM>
configuration parameter, or more, Scrip 247 will post this
information on the ASI server.</P>
<P>Please that the date used by Scrip 247 for this function is the
<I>last modified date</I> of the Trend Micro anti virus virus
definition files. 
</P>
<H4>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</EM>
configuration parameter helps minimize the likelihood that if only
one system has the latest (or newer) virus definitions, this system
not be flooded with requests for the newer virus definitions from
other systems. When the ASI client on a system successfully retrieves
virus definitions from the vendor's site, the <EM>Maximum random
delay before update (minutes)</EM> configuration parameter ensures
that requests for the newer virus definitions from other systems do
not occur simultaneously, maxmimizing the probability the the system
be able to service at least one of the requests. Once that happens,
the number of systems that can provide the newer virus definitions is
automatically doubled (at least), ensuring that all requests will be
fulfilled.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Maximum retries for obtaining local
updates</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">As its name suggests, the <I>Maximum
retries for obtaining local updates</I> configuration parameter lets
you set the number of times Scrip 247 will attempt to obtain the
newest virus definitions available on the sub-net from other systems
on the sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>3</B>.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Local update retry delay (minutes)</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">With the <I>Local update retry delay
(minutes)</I> configuration parameter, you set the time interval
between attempts Scrip 247 will make to obtain the newest virus
definitions available on the sub-net from other systems on the
sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>60 </B>minutes.</P>
<H4>Report when anti-virus product is not installed</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report when anti-virus product is not
installed</I> configuration parameter, on systems where Trend Micro
anti virus is not installed Scrip 247 will post a log on the ASI
server with this information. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">You might want to use this
configuration parameter periodically to find out which systems at a
site do not have anti virus software installed. In this way, you
would be able to intervene pro-actively and add anti virus protection
to unprotected systems before a virus infects them.</P>
<H4>Update Trend Micro anti virus now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 247 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 247, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
