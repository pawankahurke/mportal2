</UL>
<H4>Scan targets (for all local drives use /AllLocalDisks)</H4>
<P>The OfficeScan virus scan executable command-line does not have a
<I>silent</I> option. However, we are able to configure the scan so
it runs minimzed and exits when the scan is complete. At this point
in time, Scrip 249 does not support the Trend Micro Pccillin virus
scanning engine.</P>
<P>By default the value of the <EM>Scan targets (for all local drives
use /AllLocalDisks)</EM> parameter is <B>/AllLocalDisks</B>. This
results in a scan of all local fixed discs using the <B>/S /C</B>
command line parameters. You can use this configuration parameter to
change both the drives scanned and the command line parameters. For
example:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You can enter on one line <B>/S /C
	C: E:</B> - This will result in a scan of local drives <I>C:</I> and
	<I>E:</I> using the <I>/S /C</I> command line parameters</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You can enter the following on two
	different lines:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>/S /C C:</B> - This will
		result in a scan of local fixed drive <I>C:</I> using the /S /C
		command line parameters 
		</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>/S /C </B><A HREF="file:///D:/important.doc"><B>D:\important.doc</B></A>
		This will result in a scan of document important.doc on local fixed
		drive <I>D:</I> using the <I>/S /C</I> command line parameters 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You can enter the following on two
	different lines:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>/S /C C:</B> - This will
		result in a scan of local fixed drive <I>C:</I> using the <I>/S /C</I>

</OL>
<P>Note that 1. and 3. both result in scans of local fixed drives <I>C:</I>
and <I>E:</I>. In general, there are two reasons for using multiple
scan command lines:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Improve legibility</P>
	<LI><P>Use different command line arguments depending on the fixed
	local drive, directory, or document you want to scan.</P>
</UL>
<H4>Command line parameters</H4>
<P>Below you will fin the list of the Trend Micro anti virus scan
command lines options supported by Scrip 249:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /S - Scan all files in
	specified dir and all subdirs.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /C - Clean virus-infected
	files without any prompting.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /D - Delete virus-infected
	files without any prompting.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /B - Scan boot/partition
	area only.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /P - Scan hard disk
	partition only.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /NM - Do not scan memory.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /NB - Do not scan boot
	sector/partition area of disk.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /NC - Scan only, do not
	take any action on virus files.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /BK[+|-] - Clean virus
	infected files backup switch.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">option: /P=path - Specifiy virus
	pattern path.</P>
	<LI><P>option: /P=file[;file...] - Specifiy virus pattern file(s).</P>
</UL>
<P>By default, Scrip 249 uses the following command line:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>vscanwin32 /S /C /ALL</B></P>
</UL>
<H4>Report when anti-virus product is not installed</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report when anti-virus product is not
installed</I> configuration parameter, on systems where Trend Micro
anti virus is not installed Scrip 249 will post a log on the ASI
server with this information. 
</P>
<P>You might want to use this configuration parameter periodically to
find out which systems at a site do not have anti virus software
installed. In this way, you would be able to intervene pro-actively
and add anti virus protection to unprotected systems before a virus
infects them.</P>
<H4>Maximum run time (minutes)</H4>
<P>This parameter lets you control the maximum amount of time
defragmenter will be allowed to run. When setting a value keep in
mind that if a drive or drive(s) have not been defragmented for a
long time, disk defragmentation will take a significant amount of
time. If the disk drives are large and close to capacity, it could
take several hours.</P>
<P>In setting a value for this parameter you should also keep in mind
other Scrips that may be scheduled to run during the same time of day
to avoid conflict.</P>
<H4>Names of processes to shutdown</H4>
<P>The <EM>Names of processes to shutdown</EM> parameter can be used
to list all the processes you would like Scrip 249 to shut down in an
orderly fashion before starting disk defragmentation. The full name
of each process to be terminated, including extension, should be
entered on a separate line. Full location paths are not required.</P>
<P>This configuration entry should be used with care. For example,
you should not use either of the masks <STRONG>*</STRONG> or <STRONG>*.*</STRONG>
because they would have the effect of terminating both the ASI Client
and other processes (e.g. explorer.exe) that are necessary for
executing Scrip 249 (the ASI Client), and keep the system running
(explorer.exe).</P>
<P>One or more of the processes running at the time disk
defragmentation is scheduled to start that need to be shut down may
require user action or response in order to be terminated. For
example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Open network connections that in
	order to be closed require user approval 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Applications like Microsoft Word
	that require a user to save or close without saving files that have
	been changed and not saved at the time Word is terminated, or 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Information agents like Intuit Quickbooks' qbdagent.exe. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Scrip 249 handles these situations automatically. You can control
process shut-down with the <EM>Max number of seconds to wait for the
process to close</EM> and <EM>Max number of dialogs to close</EM> 
</P>
<H4>Max number of seconds to wait for the process to close</H4>
<P>This parameter lets you control how long Scrip 249 should wait
before shutting down each process that was active at the time disk
defragmentation was scheduled to start.</P>
<H4>Max number of dialogs to close</H4>
<P>In many instances, requests for user action communicated via
dialog boxes are part of process shut down sequences. Scrip 249
handles these requests automatically.</P>
<P>Whenever a dialog box requesting user input appears during a
process' shut down sequence, Scrip 249 closes it taking the default
action. For example, if the dialog box requests whether a file should
be saved or not, and the default response is <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>,
Scrip 249 will automatically click on the <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>
button.</P>
<H4>Names of processes to startup</H4>
<P>This parameter can be used to list all the processes you would
like Scrip 249 to start up after disk defragmentation is completed.
The full name of each process to be started, including extension,
should be entered on a separate line. Full location paths are not
required.</P>
<H4>Reboot system</H4>
<P>When this parameter is enabled, Scrip 249 will restart the system
after disk dfragmentation is completed.</P>
<P>Parameters <EM>Names of processes to startup</EM> and <EM>Reboot
system</EM> are independent of each other. If you want to restart the
system after disk defragmentation is completed, Scrip 249 will ignore
the list of processes to start up after disk defragmentation is
completed. If you don't want to restart the system after disk
defragmentation is completed, then Scrip 249 will look for
process(es) to start once disk defragmentation is completed.</P>
<H4>Run Trend Micro anti virus now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 249 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 249, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
