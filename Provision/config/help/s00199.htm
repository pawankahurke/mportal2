<h3>Scrip 199 Configuration</h3>

<h4>Default Configuration Parameters</h4>

<ul>
<li>Scrip disabled</li>
<li><em>Registry keys to monitor</em> list empty</li>
</ul>

<p>Scrip 199 will check for changes in the registry keys listed in the <em>Registry keys to monitor</em> list
when one of the following is true:
<ul>
<li>The client is starting up</li>
<li>The scrip has just been enabled</li>
<li>The scrip is already enabled and the list of registry keys has changed</li>
</ul>


<h4>Registry keys to monitor</h4>

<p>This parameter is used to list all the registry keys you would like Scrip 199 to monitor.
The full name of each key should be entered on a separate line.</p>

<p>To facilitate the process of entering the name of each registry key you want monitored, and minimize the probability 
of making a mistake, you can follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>run regedit</li>
<li>Locate the key you want to monitor by using regedit's <em>find</em> function</li>
<li>Once you have found the registry key you want to monitor, click on <em>Edit</em> on the regedit menu, the click on 
<em>Copy Key Name</em></li>
<li>Click the mouse in the <em>Registry keys to monitor</em> list box first open line</li>
<li>Paste the registry key copied by pressing simultaneously the <em>ctrl</em> and <em>v</em> keys</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps until all the registry keys you want to monitor are listed in 
the <em>Registry keys to monitor</em> list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that Scrip 199 will detect and report changes in the registry keys entered in the <em>Registry keys to monitor</em> 
list, and all their sub-keys. This means that selecting the registry key for a frequently used application like
Microsoft Internet Explorer, with many sub-keys, will generate a large number of event logs, most of them not 
very relevant from a system management and support standpoint.</p>

<p>Because of the above consideration, in general it is advisable to select registry keys that address specific,
and significant, system, and application configuration parameters.</p>
