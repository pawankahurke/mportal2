</UL>
<H4>Update from other accessible machines</H4>
<P>When you enabled the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM>
configuration parameter, Scrip 90 will replace the McAfee VirusScan
virus definitions on each system where this option is enabled with
the newest virus definitions found on the sub-net where the system is
installed. If none of the other virus definition update functions are
enabled, Scrip 90 ends execution after this operation is completed.</P>
<H4>Update from on-site server</H4>
<P>An <EM>on-site server</EM> is a system where McAfee VirusScan and
the McAfee update service are installed, and that is known to
consistently have up-to-date virus definitions. For example this
could be one system (or more than one) where the virus definitions
are updated manually to ensure that the update is successful.</P>
<P>If the <EM>Update from on-site server</EM> configuration parameter
is enabled, Scrip 90 will look for newer virus definitions at the
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> list.
If the <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM> configuration
parameter is enabled searching for newer virus definitions at
location(s) specified in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM>
configuration parameter occurs after Scrip 90 has completed the
search for newer virus definitions on other accessible systems on the
sub-net.</P>
<H4>Update from vendor</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Update from vendor</EM> configuration parameter is
enabled, Scrip 90 will look for newer virus definitions from McAfee's
site using MacAfee's update software. If Scrip 90 cannot find
MacAfee's update software, it logs this fact, and ends execution. If
either <EM>Update from other accessible machines</EM> or <EM>Update
from on-site server</EM>, configuration parameters, configuration
parameters, or both, are enabled, Scrip 90 will look for newer virus
definitions from McAfee's site only if it was not successful finding
newer virus definitions using the other two options.</P>
<H4>On-site server locations</H4>
<P>Each entry in the <EM>On-site server locations</EM> configuration
parameter contains the full path for an on-site server. Each entry
should be on a separate line.</P>
<H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0.06in">Date of latest
definitions</H4>
<H4 STYLE="margin-top: 0.06in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">Date of latest
ASaP definitions</H4>
<P><STRONG>The <I>Date of latest definitions</I> and <EM>Date of
latest ASaP definitions</EM> configuration parameters are displayed
for information only. It should not be modified under any
circumstances. If it were to be modified, Scrip 90 would not function
properly.</STRONG></P>
<P>The purpose of the <EM>Date of latest definitions</EM> and <I>Date
of latest ASaP definitions</I> configuration parameters is to keep a
running list of the virus definition dates for all systems running
McAfee VirusScan. As a result, when a machine is searching for
updates on other systems on the sub-net, it simply accesses this
list. It does not have to contact every machine on the subnet. This
minimizes local network traffic and bandwidth usage. From the list's
entries a system finds out the dates of virus definitions available
on the sub-net, and which system(s) has/have them.</P>
<P>The format of <EM>Date of latest definitions</EM> and <I>Date of
latest ASaP definitions</I> configuration parameter entries is as
follows: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Day, Month Day, Hour:Minute:Second, Seconds since 1970</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Wednesday, November 17, 2004 00:00:00, 1100649600</P>
</UL>
<H4>Run auto upgrade</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Auto Upgrade</EM> configuration parameter is
disabled, execution of Scrip 90 will automatically update the
VirusScan virus database.</P>
<P>When the <EM>Auto Upgrade</EM> configuration parameter is enabled,
execution of Scrip 90 will also trigger the update of the VirusScan
software. This process requires user intervention.</P>
<H4>Machines to report virus definition dates</H4>
<P>You use the <EM>Machines to report virus definition dates</EM>
configuration parameter to control which systems should report virus
definition dates on the systems on the sub-net. If you want all
systems on a sub-net to report virus definition dates, all you need
to enter in the list is a *. An empty list is equivalent to this
function being disabled.</P>
<H4>Maximum age of virus definitions in days</H4>
<P>When the date of the McAfee VirusScan virus definition database
files is older than the current date by the number of days specified
by the <EM>Maximum age of virus definitions in days</EM>
configuration parameter, or more, Scrip 90 will post this information
on the ASI server.</P>
<H4>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</EM>
configuration parameter helps minimize the likelihood that if only
one system has the latest (or newer) virus definitions, this system
not be flooded with requests for the newer virus definitions from
other systems. When the ASI client on a system successfully retrieves
virus definitions from the vendor's site, <EM>Maximum random delay
before update (minutes)</EM> ensures that requests for the newer
virus definitions from other systems do not occur simultaneously
maxmimizing the probability the the system be able to service at
least one of the requests. Once that happens, the number of systems
that can provide the newer virus definitions is automatically doubled
(at least), ensuring that all requests will be fulfilled.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Maximum retries for obtaining local
updates</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">As its name suggests, the <I>Maximum
retries for obtaining local updates</I> configuration parameter lets
you set the number of times Scrip 90 will attempt to obtain the
newest virus definitions available on the sub-net from other systems
on the sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>3</B>.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Local update retry delay (minutes)</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">With the <I>Local update retry delay
(minutes)</I> configuration parameter, you set the time interval
between attempts Scrip 90 will make to obtain the newest virus
definitions available on the sub-net from other systems on the
sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>60 </B>minutes.</P>
<H4>Report when anti-virus product is not installed</H4>
<P>If you enable the <I>Report when anti-virus product is not
installed</I> configuration parameter, on systems where McAfee
VirusScan, or McAfee ASaP are not installed Scrip 90 will post a log
on the ASI server with this information. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">You might want to use this
configuration parameter periodically to find out which systems at a
site do not have anti virus software installed. In this way, you
would be able to intervene pro-actively and add anti virus protection
to unprotected systems before a virus infects them.</P>
<H4>Command line parameters</H4>
<P>Scrip 90 does not allow the addition of any McAfee VirusScan virus
database update command line parameters to the execution of the virus
database update.</P>
<H4>Run McAfee VirusScan update now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 90 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 90, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>
