<P>Scrip 22 manages the process of retrying to send asset logs
generated by Scrip 61 (System Survey) to the ASI log server when that
process initially fails. 
</P>
<H4>Create event log for asset log failures</H4>
<P>If you enable the <EM>Create event log for asset log failures</EM>
configuration parameter, asset log failures will be logged as Scrip
22 event logs on the ASI server. By default, this configuration
parameter is disabled.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>There are two reasons why an asset logging operation can fail,
forcing the client to re-try the operation. These cases are somewhat
different, so the ASI client handles them differently:</P>
<P>If the ASI client cannot reach the server, Scrip 22 will use the
<I>Initial delay in seconds before retrying failed asset logs</I> and
the <I>Maximum delay in seconds before retrying failed asset logs</I>
configuration parameters described below to manage the asset log
transmission process.</P>
<P>In this case, there is no scarce resource. Instead, it is just a
transient failure (Note that we are ignoring the case where the
failure is caused by congestion.) Often the failures are short-lived,
so it is worthwhile to retry quickly. However, they are sometimes
lengthy failures, so it is a bad idea to consume resources by
continuously retrying. The best adaptive algorithm in this case is a
<I>fixed binary backoff</I>, where the retry delay starts at a short
interval, and the interval is doubled every retry, up to a maximum
retry interval.</P>
<H4>Initial delay in seconds before retrying failed asset logs</H4>
<P>The <I>Initial delay in seconds before retrying failed asset logs</I>
configuration parameter contains the starting value for asset log
transmission retry interval. In other words, the first time Scrip 22
cannot reach the ASI server, it will wait the number of seconds
specified in the <I>Initial delay in seconds before retrying failed
asset logs</I> configuration parameter before trying again.</P>
<H4>Maximum delay in seconds before retrying failed asset logs</H4>
<P>The <I>Maximum delay in seconds before retrying failed asset logs</I>
configuration parameter contains the maximum value for asset log
transmission retry interval. In other words, the first time Scrip 22
cannot reach the ASI server, the number of seconds it will wait
before retryuing to send an asset log will not be greater than that
specified in the <I>Maximum delay in seconds before retrying failed
asset logs</I> configuration parameter.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The defaults values for the <I>Initial delay in seconds before
retrying failed asset logs</I> and the <I>Maximum delay in seconds
before retrying failed asset logs</I> configuration parameters are
respectively 60 and 3600. This means that if the ASI client does no
succeed in sending the asset logs to the ASI server the first time,
it will retry sending them at intervals (in seconds): 60, 120, 240, ,
300, 300, 300 ...</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If the ASI client can reach the ASI server, but the ASI server
returns an error saying that it is too busy, Scrip 22 will use the
<I>Initial limit on random backoff in seconds</I> and the <I>Maximum
limit on random backoff in seconds</I> configuration parameters
described below to manage the asset log transmission process.</P>
<P>In this case, the ASI client is competing with other ASI clients
to reach the ASI server, and it has no way of knowing how many others
are involved, and how long they are taking. This is very similar to
the situation that happens when there is a collision on a coaxial
Ethernet network. So, we address it the same way, with a <I>random
binary backoff</I>. This is just like a <I>fixed binary backoff</I>,
except that the value being backed off represents the MAXIMUM delay,
and the actual delay is generated randomly as a number between zero
and the maximum delay.</P>
<H4>Initial limit on random backoff in seconds</H4>
<P>The <I>Initial limit on random backoff in seconds</I>
configuration parameter contains the starting value for the maximum
retry interval. In other words, the first time Scrip 22 gets a <B>server
busy</B> response, it will wait somewhere between zero and the number
of seconds entered in the <I>Initial limit on random backoff in
seconds</I> configuration parameter before trying again.</P>
<H4>Maximum limit on random backoff in seconds 
</H4>
<P>The <I>Maximum limit on random backoff in seconds</I>
configuration parameter contains the upper limit for the maximum
retry interval. In other words, if Scrip 22 continues to get <B>server
busy</B> responses, it will never wait longer than the number of
seconds entered in the <I>Maximum limit on random backoff in seconds</I>
configuration parameter before trying again, and it will end up
waiting somewhere between zero and this many seconds between retries.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Please note that whenever Scrip 22 succeeds in sending a log to
the ASI server, it will reset the <I>Initial limit on random backoff
in seconds</I> and the <I>Maximum limit on random backoff in seconds</I>
configuration parameters back to their default values.</B></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4>Maximum number of asset logs to queue</H4>
<P>In the <I>Maximum number of asset logs to queue</I> configuration
parameter you enter the maximum number of Scrip 61 (System Survey)
logs that the client will store on each local system.</P>
<P>The asset log queue is circular. When it reaches the maximum
length, as defined by the value of the <EM>Maximum number of asset
logs to queue</EM> configuration parameter, the next log added to the
queue replaces the oldest log in the queue.</P>
<H4>Send asset logs now</H4>
<P>Clicking on the <EM>Send asset logs now</EM> button will
immediately send all the asset logs that are in the message queue to
the ASI server for the local site.</P>
