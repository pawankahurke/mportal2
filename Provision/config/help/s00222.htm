<H4>Impersonation Support</H4>
<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This means
that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
shared resource.</P>
<P>You should enter the known user id and password in Scrip 43, as
described below. With this information, the ASI client will be able
to access shared resources on the local network as follows:</P>

<H4>Impersonation enabled</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Impersonation enabled</EM> parameter is enabled, ,
using the impersonation user id and password (and domain if
necessary) you entered in <EM>Impersonation Username</EM>,
<EM>Impersonation Password and Confirmation</EM>, and <EM>Impersonation
Domain</EM> parameters in the Scrip 43 configuration page, Scrip 222
can retrieve the properties of files and folders that reside on
shared resources on other systems on the the network, accessed either
as mapped drives(e.g. <STRONG>x:\shared folder</STRONG>), or using
UNC (Universal Naming Convention) syntax (e.g. <STRONG>\\server\\shared
folder</STRONG>).</P>
<H4>Directories or files to scan</H4>
<P><EM>Directories or files to scan</EM> parameter entries have the
following format with each value in an entry separated by a comma:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Entry status with possible values
	equal to 0, 1, or 2, corresponding respectively, to disabled,
	enabled, invalid. Scrip 222 sets the status of any entry where it
	finds an error to invalid. From then on, it will ignore such
	entries. You can delete or or correct invalid entries manually. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sub-directory scan flag. If it is
	set to 1, Scrip 222 will scan all sub-directories. When this flag is
	set to 0, Scrip 222 will ignore any sub-directory contained in the
	directory being scanned. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The full path for a file whose
	properties you want Scrip 222 to retrieve, or a directory
	specification that may have an environment variable in it. For
	example:

	<LI><P>A file group name that matches one of the file group names in
	the <EM>File groups</EM> list 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>When specifying a directory, you can use wild cards (see section
on directory wild cards at the end of this document).</P>
<P>This means that in a <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM> entry
you could specify the following path:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>*\Program Files\**\ 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>A <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM> entry with the above path
specification would retrieve properties matching the file group
specified in the entry, in all directories one or more levels below
the <I>Program Files</I> directory on every logical drive on a
system.</P>
<P>Please note that if an entry in the <EM>Directories or files to
scan</EM> list contains the full path for a file, you do not need to
have a file group parameter. 
</P>
<P>The presence of a file group parameter in a <EM>Directories or
files to scan</EM> entry, implies that the third parameter is a
directory. In that case Scrip 222 checks to see if the third
parameter exists on the local machine as a directory. If it does, It
will process it. If it doesn't, the Scrip will check to see if the
third parameter exists as a file. If it does exist as a file the
entry will be flagged as invalid and log posted by the Scrip will
include an explanation of the error it found. If the third parameter
doesn't exist as a file, and Scrip 222 cannot find the directory. it
assumes that the directory currently does not exist on the local
machine, and leaves the <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM> entry
enabled.</P>
<P>You can have as many <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM>
parameter entries as you want with each entered on a new line.</P>
<P>Scrip 222 reports properties of both files and folders. However,
you should keep in mind that the only directory properties are
<EM>Directory Name</EM> and <EM>Directory Creation Date</EM>.</P>
<H4>File groups</H4>
<P><EM>File groups</EM> parameter entries have the following format
with each value in an entry separated by a comma:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">File group name 
	</P>
	<LI><P>file masks used by Scrip 222 to find files whose properties
	you want the Scrip to retrieve, separated by commas 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>When specifying file masks, you can use the standard Microsoft
MS-DOS wild card characters <STRONG>?</STRONG> and <STRONG>*</STRONG>
in both the file name and extension.</P>
<P>You can have as many <EM>File groups</EM> parameter entries as you
want with each file group entered on a new line, and then use the
same one for every entry in the <EM>Directories or files to scan</EM>
list, or a different one for each entry in the <EM>Directories or
files to scan</EM> list.</P>
<H4>Generate report now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 222 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 222, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>

<P>A 10-14 entry for the <EM>Hours</EM> parameter would mean that a
Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 2 PM.</P>
<P>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by

<H4>Directory path wild card support</H4>
<P>Certain repetitive system maintenance and management tasks require
access to sub-directories that have the same name but have different
parent directories. For example, clean-up of temp directories on
systems running the Microsoft Windows NT based operating systems
(NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003), requires access to each user's temp
directory located in <I>[drive}:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user
name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp</I>. 
</P>
<P>In order to make it easier for you configure Scrips to perform
such repetitive tasks, we have implemented wild card directory
support, allowing wild cards anywhere in a directory path. This means
that in the example above, specification of the path for the temp
directory on all fixed and network drives would be reduced to a
single line:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">*:\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
Wild card directory support applies to any Scrip where you may need
to specify a directory path, including Scrips 60 (217-221), 61, 100,
196, 222, 225, 229, and 230. It also extends to devices, meaning that
you can use the wild card character for devices including:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fixed drives (like hard disk
	partitions)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Removable drives (like floppies)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Network drives</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CD-ROMs</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RAM disk drives</P>
	<LI><P>Unknown drive types</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\\*\c:\Windows\**\temp</PRE><P>
would scan the <I>temp</I> directory found zero or more levels below
the <I>Windows</I> directory on the <I>c:</I> drive on all reachable
systems on the local network.</P>
<P>The notation used for wild card directory support is slightly
different from the MS-DOS wild card notation. It consists of either <B>*</B>
or <B>**</B>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>*</B> matches exactly one
	directory level.</P>
	<LI><P><B>**</B> matches zero or more directory levels.</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\**\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover all directory levels where the end path consists of
<I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I> including:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
and</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
while</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover only one directory level above <I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I></P>
<P>You can use multiple instances of <B>*</B> and/or <B>**</B> in
directory path specifications. When the directory wild card support
software finds instances of multiple wild cards, it performs
left-to-right scan that looks through directories 
</P>
<P>recursively. Please note that his means that multiple <B>**</B> or
<B>*</B> in a directory path specification can cause a lot of
multiple scans through the same directory structure, which will take
a lot of time, but it will return the correct result.</P>
