	<LI><P><EM>Check monitored items now</EM> 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Continuously monitor for changes</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Continuously monitor for changes</EM> configuration
parameter is enabled, Scrip 225 will detect changes to the
directories and files listed in the <EM>Monitored items</EM>
configuration parameter as they happen and will prevent changes to
files being monitored, if so configured. When this configuration
parameter is disabled, Scrip 225 will only check for changes when it
is scheduled to run. Please note that enabling this configuration
parameter can impact performance if the directories being monitored
contain many items, and are very active.</P>
<H4>Monitored items</H4>
<P>The <EM>Monitored items</EM> configuration parameter contains the
list of directories and files monitored by Scrip 225. Each item to be
monitored is entered on a new line. The format of an item in the list
is:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>0</B> (disable) or <B>1</B>
	(enable) - this makes it possible to temporarily stop monitoring
	selected items without deleting the corresponding monitored item
	command line from the list. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sub-directory monitor flag - If it
	is set to <B>1</B>, Scrip 225 will monitor all sub-directories. When
	this flag is set to <B>0</B>, Scrip 225 will ignore any
	sub-directory contained in the directory being monitored. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Protection - If this flag is set
	to <B>1</B> Scrip 225 will prevent any changes to be made to files
	being monitored. Please note that this function applies only to
	files. When this flag is set to <B>0</B>, Scrip 225 will only detect
	and report changes made to monitored items. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Directory name - The full path for
	a directory you want Scrip 225 to monitor, or a directory
	specification that may have an environment variable in it, or wild
	cards (see section on directory wild cards at the end of this
	document). . For example: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c:\windows\system32

	</UL>
	<LI><P>File mask - The file mask to use for identifying items to
	monitor, or single file name to be monitored by Scrip 225. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>When specifying file masks, you can use the standard Microsoft
MS-DOS wild card characters <STRONG>?</STRONG> and <STRONG>*</STRONG>
in both the file name and extension.</P>
<P>Some examples of <EM>Monitored items</EM> parameter list items
are: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>0,0,0,c:\,*.txt</STRONG> -
	Scrip 225 will ignore this entry because it is disabled 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><STRONG>1,0,1,%windir%\system32,*.dll</STRONG>
	- This command line is enabled. It covers the system32 sub-directory
	in the Windows directory and monitors and prevent any changes to be
	made to existing dll files 
	</P>
	<LI><P><STRONG>1,1,0,C:\Program Files\Microsoft
	Office\Templates\,*.dot</STRONG> - This command line is enabled. It
	covers <STRONG>Templates</STRONG> directory and all its sub
	directories. It monitors files of type <STRONG>dot</STRONG>
	(Microsoft Word template files) but does not prevent changes from
	being made to them. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that when a command line in the <EM>Monitored items</EM>
configuration parameter is disabled, the stored information about the
directory and its contents is removed. When a command line is
enabled, the information about the directory and its contents is
re-generated.</P>
<H4>Note about Scrip 225 execution</H4>
<P>Scrip 225 runs when one of the following events occurs:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the ASI client starts up.
	When this happens it checks for changes 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you click on the execute
	button to the right of the <EM>Check monitored items now</EM> label.
	When this happens it checks for changes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At its scheduled time. When this
	happens it checks for changes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When monitored item(s) change.
	When this happens it checks for changes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When one of its configuration
	parameter changes. When this happens it updates the configuration. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When it is enabled/disabled. When this happens it updates the
	configuration. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Checking for changes means:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Determining if any files or
	directories have been removed, added or altered, and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Updating the stored information about any item that has
	changed 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Updating the configuration means updating the stored information
about monitored item(s) to match their current state. If any existing
stored information for monitored item(s) is still relevant, then it
is re-used. 
</P>
<P>If you enabled protection for a command line in the <EM>Monitored
items</EM> parameter(value set to 1), instead of just updating the
stored information (checksum contained in the ASI client's persistent
state repository) for the item(s) in that command line, when an item
changes, Scrip 225 will restore the item to its pre-change state by
overwriting the changed item with the copy that was stored in the
hidden directory <I>225</I> contained in the ASI client directory
when the item was first added to a (part of) <EM>Monitored items</EM>
parameter command line.</P>
<P>Please note that Scrip 225 will restore any protected file or
directory with the backup copy stored in the not only if an attempt
is made to change them but also if they are deleted.</P>
<P>If you change the copies of the files and/or directories you have
configured Scrip 225 to monitor (and protect) that are stored in
directory 225, the Scrip will not update the changed item's (or
items') checksum information until it is disabled and then
re-enabled, or the ASI client is restarted.</P>
<H4>Check monitored items now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 225 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 225, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
<P>The table below describes each field in detail.</P>

<P>The <EM>Minutes</EM>, <EM>Hours</EM>, <EM>Day of the Month</EM>,
<EM>Month</EM>, and <EM>Day of the Week</EM> fields can have multiple
values and ranges of values separating them with commas.</P>
<P>For example, a 1,3,5 entry for the <EM>Minutes</EM> parameter
would mean that a Scrip would be executed at minutes 1, 3, and 5.</P>
<P>A 10-14 entry for the <EM>Hours</EM> parameter would mean that a
Scrip would be executed starting at 10 AM and ending at 2 PM.</P>
<P>Multiple value and range entries can be used together separated by
commas.</P>
<H4>Directory path wild card support</H4>
<P>Certain repetitive system maintenance and management tasks require
access to sub-directories that have the same name but have different
parent directories. For example, clean-up of temp directories on
systems running the Microsoft Windows NT based operating systems
(NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003), requires access to each user's temp
directory located in <I>[drive}:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user
name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp</I>. 
</P>
<P>In order to make it easier for you configure Scrips to perform
such repetitive tasks, we have implemented wild card directory
support, allowing wild cards anywhere in a directory path. This means
that in the example above, specification of the path for the temp
directory on all fixed and network drives would be reduced to a
single line:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">*:\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
Wild card directory support applies to any Scrip where you may need
to specify a directory path, including Scrips 60 (and 217-221), 61,
100, 196, 222, 225, 229, and 230. It also extends to devices, meaning
that you can use the wild card character for devices including:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fixed drives (like hard disk
	partitions)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Removable drives (like floppies)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Network drives</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CD-ROMs</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">RAM disk drives</P>
	<LI><P>Unknown drive types</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\\*\c:\Windows\**\temp</PRE><P>
would scan the <I>temp</I> directory found zero or more levels below
the <I>Windows</I> directory on the <I>c:</I> drive on all reachable
systems on the local network.</P>
<P>The notation used for wild card directory support is slightly
different from the MS-DOS wild card notation. It consists of either <B>*</B>
or <B>**</B>:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>*</B> matches exactly one
	directory level.</P>
	<LI><P><B>**</B> matches zero or more directory levels.</P>
</UL>
<P>For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\**\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover all directory levels where the end path consists of
<I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I> including:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
and</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
while</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">\Documents and Settings\*\Local Settings\Temp\</PRE><P>
would cover only one directory level above <I>\Local Settings\Temp\</I></P>
<P>You can use multiple instances of <B>*</B> and/or <B>**</B> in
directory path specifications. When the directory wild card support
software finds instances of multiple wild cards, it performs
left-to-right scan that looks through directories 
</P>
<P>recursively. Please note that his means that multiple <B>**</B> or
<B>*</B> in a directory path specification can cause a lot of
multiple scans through the same directory structure, which will take
a lot of time, but it will return the correct result.</P>
