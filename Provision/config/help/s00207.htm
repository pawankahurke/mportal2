<P>Please note that when specifying a file, you can use standard
MS-DOS wild cards, <B>* ?</B>.</P>
<P>If the file being distributed does not exist on a system on the
sub-net, when Scrip 207 runs, it will place a copy of the file with
the latest &quot;last modified&quot; date on the sub-net, on that
system, and log the absence of the file on that system in an event
log.</P>
<P>You can have as many <EM>Content distribution actions</EM>
configuration parameter entries as you want, each entered on a new
line.</P>
<H4>Latest dates on the sub-net</H4>
<P><STRONG>The <EM>Latest dates on the sub-net</EM> configuration
parameter is displayed for information only. It should not be
modified under any circumstances. If it were to be modified, Scrip
207 would not function properly.</STRONG></P>
<P>The purpose of the <I>Latest dates on the sub-net</I>
configuration parameter is to keep a running list of the latest dates
(currently a files's last modified date) for all systems where a copy
of the file being distributed is located. As a result, when a machine
is searching for the file(s) listed in the <I>Content distribution
actions</I> configuration parameter on other systems on the sub-net,
it simply accesses this list. It does not have to contact every
machine on the sub-net. This minimizes local network traffic and
bandwidth usage. From the list's entries a system finds out the dates
of virus definitions available on the sub-net, and which system(s)
has/have them.</P>
<P>The format of the <I>Latest dates on the sub-net</I> configuration
parameter entries is as follows: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Method used to determine the
	file's age. Currently, it must be set <B>1</B>, meaning that the

</UL>
<H4>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</H4>
<P>The <EM>Maximum random delay before update (minutes)</EM>
configuration parameter helps minimize the likelihood that if only
one system has the copy of the file(s) being distributed with the
latest date (last modified), this system not be flooded with requests
for the copy of the file(s) from other systems. The <EM>Maximum
random delay before update (minutes)</EM> configuration parameter
ensures that requests for a newer copy of the file(s) being
distributed from other systems do not occur simultaneously,
maxmimizing the probability the the system be able to service at
least one of the requests. Once that happens, the number of systems
that can provide the latest (based on last modified date) copy of the
file(s) being distributed is automatically doubled (at least),
ensuring that all requests will be fulfilled.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Maximum retries for obtaining local
updates</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">As its name suggests, the <I>Maximum
retries for obtaining local updates</I> configuration parameter lets
you set the number of times Scrip 207 will attempt to obtain the
latest (based on last modified date) copy of the file being
distributed available on the sub-net from other systems on the
sub-net. By default, its value is set to <B>3</B>.</P>
<H4 STYLE="font-style: normal">Local update retry delay (minutes)</H4>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">With the <I>Local update retry delay
(minutes)</I> configuration parameter, you set the time interval
between attempts Scrip 207 will make to obtain the latest (based on
last modified date) copy of the file(s) being distributed available
on the sub-net from other systems on the sub-net. By default, its
value is set to <B>60 </B>minutes.</P>
<H4>Update files now</H4>
<P>With the <EM>Execute</EM> button, you can run Scrip 207 on demand,
even if it's not enabled. In Scrip 207, the <EM>Execute</EM> button
can be used to execute the Scrip on the local system or on all
supported systems.</P>
<H4>Schedule</H4>
<P>The Schedule parameter has a command line with eight fields, each
entered on a new line.</P>
