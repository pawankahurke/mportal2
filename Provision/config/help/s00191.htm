</UL>
<H4>Minimum time (sec) between consecutive failures</H4>
<P><EM>Minimum time (sec) between consecutive failures</EM> is the
amount of time measured in seconds that has to pass between two
failures on the same machine/port combination in order for the second
to be considered a &quot;new&quot; failure. if the second failure
happens within a time interval that is shorter than the number of
seconds specified in <EM>Minimum time (sec) between consecutive
failures</EM>, it is ignored. If it occurs outside of this time
interval, it is diagnosed.</P>
<P>The <EM>Minimum time (sec) between consecutive failures</EM>
parameter currently only has any effect at all if Scrip 191 is
actually diagnosing a problem when the same problem happens again.</P>
<P>Most of the time, when a connectivity problem occurs, Scrip 191
diagnoses it and logs the result, and then removes it from the queue
of problems. When a second failure occurs, if there is nothing like
it in the problem queue, Scrip 191 diagnoses it. The <EM>Minimum time
(sec) between consecutive failures</EM> parameter has no effect.</P>
<P>However, if failure #1 happens, and Scrip 191 has it queued or is
currently diagnosing it, and then failure #2 occurs with the same
address and port as failure #1, then:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If the the user interface is
	enabled (i.e. the port where the failure occurred is listed in <EM>User
	interface enabled on failure of these ports</EM>) for the diagnosis
	of failure #1 (and therefore also #2), then Scrip 191 discards
	failure #2. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If the user interface is not enabled, then it checks the
	difference between the time of failure #1 and the time of failure
	#2. If that is less than the time netered in the <EM>Minimum time
	(sec) between consecutive failures</EM> parameter, then it discards
	#2. Otherwise it puts #2 into the queue to be diagnosed. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>If the value of <EM>Minimum time (sec) between consecutive
failures</EM> is set to <STRONG>0</STRONG> (the default value), it is
equivalent to an <EM>infinite</EM> <EM>Minimum time (sec) between
consecutive failures</EM>. Scrip 191 will always discard failure #2,
if it is in the process of diagnosing failure #1, whether or not the
user interface is enabled. This case should be rather rare, unless
there has been a whole string of failures and Scrip 191 is backing up
because the user interface is enabled and each one has to time out in
diagnosis.</P>
<H4>Seconds between retries</H4>
<P>When the user interface is enabled (see below), the <EM>Seconds
between retries</EM> parameter is the time interval between each test
to see if network connectivity has been re-established.</P>
<P>Scrip 191 updates the end-user on the status of the failed service
/ component at intervals based on the length <EM>Seconds between
retries</EM>.</P>
<H4>Number of failures between dialog boxes</H4>
<P><EM>Number of failures between dialog boxes</EM> is the number of
tests that are performed to see if network connectivity has been
re-established between interactions with the end-user when the user
interface is enabled.</P>
<P>For example, if <EM>Seconds between retries</EM> is set to 60
seconds, and <EM>Number of failures between dialog boxes</EM> is set
to 3, then Scrip 191 will test to see if connectivity has been
re-established every minute, but only update the end-user on the
status via a dialog box every 3 minutes.</P>
<H4>Dialog box timeout (sec) if no user present</H4>
<P><EM>Dialog box timeout (sec) if no user present</EM> is the amount
of time that Scrip 191 will wait before acting on behalf of the user
to either close a dialog box or perform the default action presented
by a dialog box</P>
<P>For those dialog boxes that require the user to decide whether to
be notified when a failed service is available again, if the user
takes no action before <EM>Dialog box timeout (sec) if no user
present</EM> is exceeded, Scrip 191 will assume that the user wants
to be notified when the failed service is available again.</P>
<H4>Maximum number of resolution dialogs</H4>
<P><EM>Maximum number of resolution dialogs</EM> is the maximum
number of times that dialog boxes informing the user about problem
resolution status will appear on the screen of the user's system.</P>
<H4>Timeout (msec) for ping in diagnosis</H4>
<P><EM>Timeout (msec) for ping in diagnosis</EM> is the <STRONG>-w</STRONG>
ping command line parameter that lets you set the amount of time in
milliseconds that ping waits for each reply before timing out.</P>
<H4>Repeat count for ping in diagnosis</H4>
<P><EM>Repeat count for ping in diagnosis</EM> is the <STRONG>-n</STRONG>
ping command line parameter that lets you set the number of ping
requests to send before returning a failure response.</P>
<H4>Maximum delay (sec) for detecting self-induced failures</H4>
<P>With <EM>Maximum delay (sec) for detecting self-induced failures</EM>
you control the time lag Scrip 191 uses when it compares connectivity
failures caused by the ASI client with ones detected by the network
device driver. If the port and address match, and time the failure
was detected by each falls within <EM>Maximum delay (sec) for
detecting self-induced failures</EM>, Scrip 191 will ignore the
connectivity failure as it was caused by the ASI client.<BR>The
reason for this is to allow for processing delays between detection
of a connectivity problem by the network driver when compared to the
ASI client, particularly on slower systems</P>
<H4>Ports to include for failure detection</H4>
<P>The <EM>Ports to include for failure detection</EM> list contains
the IP services ports that you want Scrip 191 to monitor for failure
detection and diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>As indicated by the <STRONG>*</STRONG>, by default this list
includes all IP services ports.</P>
<P>Entries in the <EM>Ports to include for failure detection</EM>
list should be separated by a comma.</P>
<H4>Ports to exclude for failure detection</H4>
<P>The <EM>Ports to exclude for failure detection</EM> list contains
the IP services ports that you want Scrip 191 to not monitor for
failure detection and diagnosis. From time to time, you might want to
use this parameter to list ports that you know would not respond for
a known (temporary) reason. In such a case Scrip 191's detection of a
connectivity failure would be superfluous.</P>
<P>By default, this list is empty.</P>
<P>Entries in the <EM>Ports to include for failure detection</EM>
list should be separated by a comma.</P>
<H4>IP addresses and domains to exclude for failure logging</H4>
<P>There may be situations where over time you determine that
failures to connect to certain IP address or domain name are always
transient and don't result in an end-user's inability to access a
service. In these cases, you can enter these IP address and/or domain
names in <EM>IP addresses and domains to exclude for failure logging</EM>,
each on a separate line. Whenever fialure to connect to any of the IP
addresses and domains in this list occurs, Scrip 191 will ignore it.</P>
<P>For example, applications such as instant messaging may fail to
reach one of a pool of servers. This does not mean that the attempt
to establish connectivity failed. Generally, these connectivity
failures can be ignored.</P>
<H4>User Interface enabled on failure of these ports</H4>
<P>The <EM>User Interface enabled on failure of these ports</EM> list
contains the IP services ports for whose failures you want Scrip 191
to interact with end-users.</P>
<P>The user interface for Scrip 191 consists of three dialog boxes.
The first one lets end-users know that they lost TCP/IP network
connectivity. The second one informs them about the cause of the
failure. The third, at their option, notifies them when TCP/IP
network connectivity is re-established.</P>
<P>Entries in the <EM>User Interface enabled on failure of these
ports</EM> list should be separated by commas with no spaces.</P>
<P>By default, this list is empty.</P>
<H4>User Interface disabled on failure of these ports</H4>
<P>The <EM>User Interface disabled on failure of these ports</EM>
list contains the IP services ports for whose failures you want Scrip
191 to not interact with end-users.</P>
<P>By default, this list is empty.</P>
<P>Entries in the <EM>User Interface disabled on failure of these
ports</EM> list should be separated by a comma.</P>
<H4>User Interface disabled on failure of these IP addresses and
domains</H4>
<P>When Scrip 191 detects a failure to reach the IP addresses and
domains contained in the <EM>User Interface disabled on failure of
these IP addresses and domains</EM> parameter, it will not report the
failure to the end-user but will continue to produce an event log
with all the detection and diagnostic information.</P>
<P>This function is useful in a number of situations. For example:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If you have a service that can be
	accessed via a pool of servers, you may still want Scrip 191 to
	detect, diagnose, and log connectivity failures to track the load
	and reliability on the servers in the pool even though these
	connectivity failures do not result in a loss of service. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>It can also be a powerful tool for identifying IP addresses
	and domains that may be accessed by a program that was installed
	without the end-user's knowledge (e.g. spyware, or other intrusion
	program). 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Entries in the <EM>IP addresses and domains to exclude for both
logging and user interface</EM> list can be one per line, or all on
one line, with each entry separated by a comma.</P>
<H4>Report immediately when User Interface enabled</H4>
<P>When the <EM>Report immediately when User Interface enabled</EM>
parameter is enabled, Scrip 191 will notify the end-user about a
TCP/IP connectivity failure immediately, before proceeding with
failure diagnosis.</P>
<H4>Custom message for final user interface notification</H4>
<P>In the <EM>Custom message for final user interface notification</EM>
parameter, you can enter the message you want Scrip 191 to display
when the last notification message is displayed indicating that the
failed device or service is not yet available. For example, you can
have a message with instructions that the end-user should follow to
work-around the problem, or contact information for the support
center.</P>
<H4>Delay based thresholding</H4>
<P><EM>Enable delay based threshold for user interface</EM> turns on
this feature. <EM>Maximum counted events in delay-based threshold</EM>
is the maximum value beyond which the &quot;current activity level&quot;
will not go. <EM>Decay rate for delay-based threshold</EM> is the
value of the constant <STRONG>k</STRONG> in the activity level decay
function <STRONG>exp(-k * t)</STRONG>. <EM>Threshold value for
delay-based threshold</EM> is the threshold above which the &quot;current
activity level&quot; prevents a dialog box from being displayed</P>
<P>Delay based thresholding of Internet connectivity problem
notifications prevents the user from being notified too frequently in
case multiple Internet connectivity failures on a system where Scrip
191 is enabled, occur close to each other.</P>
<P>Please note that delay based thresholding limits the frequency of
notifications to end-users. It does not affect Interent connectivity
failure detection and diagnosis.</P>
<P>If delay based thresholding is enabled, then a &quot;current
activity level&quot; is maintained, and if the &quot;current activity
level&quot; is above a threshold, then no user notification dialog
box is displayed.</P>
<P>Here is how delay based thresholding works.</P>
<P>On system A, Scrip 191 with delay based thresholding is enabled.</P>
<P>At time 0, Scrip 191 detects an Internet connectivity problem. If
the user interface is enabled, the first end-user notification dialog
box, notifying the user of the problem and offering to notify him/her
when the problem is resolved, is displayed.</P>
<P>The activity level on system A is increased from 0 to 1. At the
same time, the exponential decay function, <STRONG>exp(-k*t)</STRONG>
is multiplied by the activity level on system A with <EM>K</EM> set
to <STRONG>0.1</STRONG> by default. This has the effect of
immediately reducing the value of the activity level (decaying it).</P>
<P>At time 1, another Internet connectivity problem occurs on system
A. The activity level <EM>decayed</EM>, as described above, is
compared to the <EM>Threshold value for delay based threshold</EM>,
which by default is set to <STRONG>0.1</STRONG>. As long as the level
of activity is greater than or equal to the <EM>Threshold value for
delay based threshold</EM>, end-user notification dialog boxes for
any subsequent ones will not be displayed.</P>
<P>Please note that the notifications for the first event will
continue to be generated, because the current activity level is zero
at that point, which is less than the threshold. This is also the
case after there have been no events in a long time and the current
activity level has decayed back down to zero. 
</P>
<P>The level of activity is also compared to the value of <EM>Maximum
counted events in delay based threshold</EM>. If it is less than
<EM>Maximum counted events in delay based threshold</EM>, no action
is taken. If it is greater, the level of activity is set to <EM>Maximum
counted events in delay based threshold</EM>, which by default is set
to <STRONG>3</STRONG>. In this case, since the level of activity is
less than <STRONG>3</STRONG>, no action is taken. Effectively, this
means that a number of rapidly occurring Internet related
connectivity failures will be ignored, avoiding the possibility that
the activity level be set so high as to make it extremely difficult
for it to ever decay sufficiently to let any end-user notifications
to be generated.</P>
<P>Since at this point in our example the level of activity is
greater than the <EM>Threshold value for delay based threshold</EM>.
No end-user notifications for Internet connectivity problems are
displayed. This state of things will continue as long as the activity
level is greater than or equal to the <EM>Threshold value for delay
based threshold</EM>. 
</P>
<P>As time goes on, if no new Internet connectivity problems occur,
the activity level will continue to decay because the value of the
exponential decay function <STRONG>exp(-k*t)</STRONG> it is
multiplied to, will continue to decrease as a function of time.</P>
<P>If another Internet connectivity problem occurs on system A before
the level of activity can reach a value lower than the <EM>Threshold
value for delay based threshold</EM>, the process of increasing the
value of the level of activity by one each time an event occurs,
multiplying it by the exponential decay function, and comparing it to
the <EM>Threshold value for delay based threshold</EM>, will
continue, and no end-user notification dialog boxes will be displayed
although Scrip 191 will continue to detect, diagnose, and report all
Internet related connectivity problems occurring on system A.</P>
<P>Even when delay based thresholding is enabled, two kinds of
end-user dialog box notifications generated by Scrip 191 will
continue to be appear: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Those that alert an end-user that
	a failed Internet based service is once again available 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The <EM>Custom message for final User Interface notification</EM>
	that notifies an end-user that a failed Internet based service is
	still not available, and provides information for when thefollow-up
	actions, when the maximum number of notification dialog boxes as set
	in Scrip 191's <EM>Maximum number of resolution dialogs</EM>
	parameter is reached. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>In addition to setting the value of <EM>Maximum counted events in
delay based threshold</EM> and <EM>Threshold value for delay based
threshold</EM>, you can also set the value of the constant <EM>K</EM>
in the exponential decay function <STRONG>exp(-k*t)</STRONG> via the
<EM>Decay rate for delay based threshold</EM> parameter. Its default
value is <STRONG>0.1</STRONG>.</P>
<P>With these settings, the longest period of time an end-user
notification dialog box will not be generated after an Internet
connectivity problem is detected, is <STRONG>34 seconds</STRONG>.
This is because <STRONG>3*exp(-3.4)</STRONG> is greater than <STRONG>0.1</STRONG>
but <STRONG>3*exp(-3.5)</STRONG> is less than <STRONG>0.1</STRONG>. 
</P>
<P>Please note that variations in the <EM>Decay rate for delay based
threshold</EM> parameter have the greatest impact on the length of
the period of time no end-user notification dialog boxes will be
displayed.</P>
