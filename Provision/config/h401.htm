<H3>Advanced Scrip Configuration Action Status Page</H3>
<P>In the <I>Scrip Configuration Action Status</I> page you can
access the latest Scrip configuration changes made on your ASI
server. By <I>latest Scrip configuration changes</I> we mean, for
example, that if you change the configuration of Scrip 96 on system
A, call it change X, then 10 minutes later you change it again, call
it change Y, the Scrip Configuration Action Status page will display
first change X, then 10 minutes later, will display change Y and
remove change X from the page, only if change X and change Y are the
same change. If Scrip configuration changes X and Y did not change
the same Scrip configuration variable(s), they would generate two
entries in the Scrip Configuration Action Status page, even if both
are changes to the same Scrip on the same system.</P>
<P>In the advanced Scrip Configuration Action Status page, <FONT COLOR="#000000">Scrip
configuration change actions are broken down into individual
machine/Scrip configuration variable combinations. For example, if
you made a change to three configuration variables in one Scrip on a
group of ten machines, this would result into 30 entries in the
advanced Scrip Configuration Action Status page. </FONT>
</P>
<P>On each Scrip configuration change entry listed in the <I>Scrip
Configuration Action Status</I> page, you can perform a number of
actions.
