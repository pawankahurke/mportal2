<H3>Microsoft Update Management (MUM) Section Date Parameters</H3>
<HR SIZE=1 COLOR="#333399" NOSHADE>
<H4>Definitions</H4>
<P><B>Scheduler</B> - Lets you define the period covered by a
section. If it is checked, the section will use any schedule(s) you
assign to a report containing the section. If the &quot;Scheduler&quot;
configuration option is unchecked, you will be able to define the
coverage period for the date type (Detect, Download, Install,
Removal, Error, Last Change, Next Action) whose &quot;Scheduler&quot;
configuration option you unchecked. 
</P>
<P><B>Restrict</B> - Lets you restrict the coverage period defined to
a single date type (Detect, Download, Install, Removal, Error, Last
Change, Next Action). For example, suppose you check the &quot;Restrict&quot;
configuration parameter for the &ldquo;install date&rdquo; date type
parameter. The section will report only information about Microsoft
software updates whose installation dates match the dates defined in
any schedule assigned to reports using the section, or the date range
entered via the start and end dates, if the &quot;Scheduler&quot;
configuration parameter is disabled. 
</P>
<P>Consider the following usage of the restrict configuration
parameter for the &ldquo;install date&rdquo; date type:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>When defining or editing a section, you check &quot;Restrict&quot;
	for the &ldquo;install date&rdquo; type. If &quot;Scheduler&quot; is
	checked, a report using this section will only include status
	entries with installation date matching the period of any
	schedule(s) attached to the report. For example, if you assign to a
	report a schedule that runs daily at 1 AM, the report will only
	include updates that were installed from yesterday at 1 AM to the
	current time (1 AM today).</P>
	<LI><P>When defining or editing a section, you check &quot;Restrict&quot;
	for the &ldquo;install date&rdquo; type. If &quot;Scheduler&quot; is
	not checked, a report using this section will only include status
	entries with installation date matching the period specified. For
	example, you could enter a start date of 1/1/07 and an end date of
	2/1/07 to get a list of updates installed in January 2007.</P>
</UL>
<P>You can enable the &quot;Restrict&quot; configuration option for
only one date type (Detect, Download, Install, Removal, Error, Last
Change, Next Action) at a time. When you do, all other &quot;Scheduler&quot;
and &quot;Restrict&quot; configuration options are disabled. 
</P>
<H5>IMPORTANT NOTE</H5>
<P>The &ldquo;Status&rdquo; configuration parameter in the
&ldquo;Add/Copy/Edit a Section&rdquo; pages, lets you retrieve MUM
update records by their current status on a machine-by-machine basis.</P>
<P>The &ldquo;date type&rdquo; configuration parameters in the
&ldquo;Add/Copy/Edit a Section&rdquo; pages (Detect, Download,
Install, Removal, Error, Last Change, Next Action), let you retrieve
MUM update records based on the occurrence of update activity of a
certain type.</P>
<P>You should be careful about configuring sections where you select
values for both the &ldquo;Status&rdquo; and &ldquo;date type&rdquo;
configuration parameters. Most combinations of &ldquo;Status&rdquo;
and &ldquo;date type&rdquo; configuration parameter values result in
no MUM update records retrieved.</P>
<P><U>Example 1</U> &ndash; Restricted section with a defined
coverage period. Suppose you defined a section as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Status &ndash; Detected</P>
	<LI><P>Install Date &ndash; &ldquo;Restrict&rdquo; checked,
	&ldquo;Scheduler&rdquo; unchecked, Start Date &ndash; 03/01/07, End
	Date &ndash; 4/1/07 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>A section defined in this way will retrieve all updates which <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">have
a detected state and installation activity</SPAN> in March 2007,
regardless of the schedule assigned to a report using this section.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
This could happen if the disk on a system was replaced, or one or
more updates were removed.</SPAN></P>
<P><U>Example 2</U> &ndash; Restricted section with a periodic
coverage period. Suppose you defined a section as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Status &ndash; Installed</P>
	<LI><P>Detect Date &ndash; &ldquo;Restrict&rdquo; checked,
	&ldquo;Scheduler&rdquo; checked</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">A section defined in this way will
retrieve all updates which have installed status and detect activity
during the period covered by the schedule assigned to the report.</P>
<P><U>Example 3</U> &ndash; Status section. Suppose you defined a
section as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Status &ndash; Installed 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Date types &ndash; All scheduler configuration options
	checked</P>
</UL>
<P>When you use this section in a report, the report will include all
MUM update records with installed status, which had MUM related
activity during the period covered by the report. Please note that if
no updates with installed status had any MUM related activity during
the period covered by the report, the report will be empty.</P>
<HR SIZE=1 COLOR="#333399" NOSHADE>
<H4>Notes</H4>
<P>If you do not want to specify ranges for date configuration
parameters on this &quot;Edit a Microsoft Update Management Section&quot;
page, leave all &quot;Schedules&quot; configuration parameter boxes
checked. In this way, when this section is included in a report, it
will use the schedule(s) assigned to the report. 
</P>
<P>Please remember that you can enable the &quot;Restrict&quot;
configuration option for only one date type at a time. When you do
all other &quot;Scheduler&quot; and &quot;Restrict&quot;
configuration parameters will be grayed out. 
</P>
<P>If you disable the &quot;Scheduler&quot; configuration option for
more than one date type, the period covered by the section will be a
period including both coverage periods entered in the start and end
dates for the date types whose &quot;Scheduler&quot; configuration
parameter was unchecked. 
</P>
<P>For example, suppose you disable the &quot;Scheduler&quot;
configuration option for &quot;detect&quot; and &quot;install&quot;
date types, and enter: detected date interval -- Start date - 1/1/07
and End date - 2/1/07 install date interval -- Start date - 1/15/07
and End date - 2/15/07 
</P>
<P>Also assume that the &quot;Restrict&quot; configuration option is
not enabled for either &quot;detect&quot; or &quot;install&quot; date
types, then a report including a section with date types configured
as described above, will include those MUM status entries where the
detect date is between 1/1/07 and 2/1/07 OR the install date is
between 1/15/07 and 2/15/07 (the OR is important). MUM status entries
not matching either date range will not be included. 
</P>
<P>If you want to specify a coverage period for any of the date
configuration parameters on the &quot;Edit a Microsoft Update
Management Section&quot; page, you should uncheck the &quot;Schedules&quot;
box for the corresponding date configuration parameter, and enter the
start and end dates for the desired coverage period. This entry will
override for this section, any schedule assigned to a report
including this section. 
</P>
<P>If you want a section to report only MUM events with a date (e.g.
installation date) falling within a certain period of time, you
should uncheck the &quot;Scheduler&quot; box for the corresponding
date configuration parameter, enter the start and end dates for the
desired coverage period, and check the &quot;Restrict&quot;
configuration parameter box. This entry will override for this
section, any schedule assigned to a report including this section,
and all other date configuration parameter settings on the &quot;Edit
a Microsoft Update Management Section&quot; page will be ignored. 
</P>
