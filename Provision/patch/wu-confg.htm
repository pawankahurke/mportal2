<H3>Search and Display Options Panel Parameters</H3>
<P>Any field used to filter software update entries will be displayed
in the software update table. In order to have a field displayed in
the table even if you do not use it as a search parameter, select the
(all) option from its pull down list in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Search
and Display Options</FONT> panel. If you do not want a field
displayed in the table, simply select (not displayed) from its pull
down list in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Search and Display Options</FONT>
panel.</P>
<P>Dates can only be selected in daily increments up to two weeks
from the current date, weekly increments from two weeks up to one
month, monthly increments from the second month up to six months, and
up to one year beyond six months. You cannot select an end date
different from the current date.</P>
<P>If you want to sort software update table entries by more than one
parameter (e.g. site/machine/update), you should use the Sort-by
options in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Search and Display Options</FONT>
panel. To sort table entries by a single parameter, simply click on
the column heading corresponding to that parameter (e.g. Status).
Clicking once sorts entries in descending order, twice sorts them in
ascending order.</P>
<H4>Name Contains</H4>
<P>In the <I>Name Contains</I> search parameter, you can enter a
single string of alphanumeric characters. The search performed will
be a non-case sensitive sub-string match.</P>
<H4>Update Group</H4>
<P>The <I>Search and Display Options</I> panel includes the <I>Update
Group</I> field. Currently, none of the software update wizards give
you the option to define software update groups. The wizards define
software update groups automatically in order to perform software
update tasks. The names of these software update groups, e.g.
<B>Wiz_CRIT_PG $MGRP</B> , are not meaningful to you. The membership
of these software update groups changes every time the software
update task they were created for is executed again. ASI also
features a number of built-in software groups:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>All</B> This patch category
	should contain only one group, <B>All</B>. The group should contain
	every patch known to the server. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Updates</B> This category contains one patch group for
	every patch known to the server. Each group will have the same name
	as its associated patch, and should contain just that one patch. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Detected</H4>
<P>Filtering software updates using the <I>Detected</I> search
parameter, lets you quickly identify the software updates that have
been detected as applicable to the systems you selected for the
update wizard action, but have not yet been downloaded or installed.</P>
<H4>Installed</H4>
<P>Filtering software updates using the <I>Installed</I> search
parameter, lets you quickly identify the software updates that have
been installed on the systems you selected for the update wizard
action, without having to access the MUM status page
(https://asiservername/main/patch/wu-stats.php).</P>
<H4>Type</H4>
<P>The software update <B>type</B> built-in group includes all
Microsoft software update types. The group has the following six
members:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Update</P>
	<LI><P>Service Pack</P>
	<LI><P>Rollup</P>
	<LI><P>Security</P>
	<LI><P>Critical</P>
	<LI><P>Mandatory 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that since the <B>type</B> software update group is
built-in you cannot change it in any way.</P>
<H4>Internal Priority</H4>
<P>Scrip 237 assigns internal priorities to Microsoft software
updates. Internal priority values tell you which updates Scrip 237
treats as more important than others. The higher the value of the
internal priority, the more important the update is. More important
updates must be installed or declined before less important updates
can be installed or declined.</P>
<P>For example, suppose that Microsoft software update A has an
internal priority of 4. At one time on one machine, Scrip 237
<B>detected</B> update A. It was displayed on the MUM status page as
<B>detected</B>. Then, sometime later, before update A was installed,
Microsoft released update B which has an internal priority of 5. Once
Scrip 237 detects update B, it gives <B>waiting</B> status to update
A, and update B becomes <B>detected</B> instead. Update A will not be
installed (transition to <B>detected</B> state) until update B is
installed.</P>
<P>Below, is the list of internal priority values used by Scrip 237
(Microsoft Update Management):</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>0 - Drivers</P>
	<LI><P>1 - Updates</P>
	<LI><P>3 - Service Packs</P>
	<LI><P>4 - Update Rollups</P>
	<LI><P>4 - Security Updates</P>
	<LI><P>4 &ndash; Critical Updates</P>
	<LI><P>5 &ndash; Mandatory Updates</P>
</UL>
<P>Mandatory and critical software updates are always detected,
downloaded, and installed before any other software updates are even
detected. Service packs will not be detected, downloaded, or
installed until both of the following conditions are met:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>All mandatory updates are installed.</P>
	<LI><P>All critical, security, and update rollups are either
	declined or installed. If an update is declined, Scrip 237 will
	ignore the update and proceed down to one with a lower internal
	priority, if there are none with equal internal priority.</P>
</OL>
<P>Please note that since drivers have the precedence value of 0,
they will never be detected, downloaded, or installed.</P>
<H4>Update Size</H4>
<P>The <I>Update Size</I> search parameter lets you filter updates by
size in the following ranges:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">0 - 100 KB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">100 KB - 500 KB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">500 KB - 1 MB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 MB - 10MB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">10 MB - 50 MB 
	</P>
	<LI><P>over 50 MB 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that you cannot select updates by size <B>across</B>
the above ranges. For example, you cannot search for updates with
size ranging between 100 Kbytes and 1 Mbyte.</P>
<HR>
<P>The values for each of the following search parameters in the
<I>Search and Display Options</I> panel comes from different sources
depending on the version of the Microsoft AU (automated update)
client installed on the machines the information comes from. Please
note that the values for all of these fields are extracted from the
software update records downloaded from Microsoft. Scrip 237 does not
use or change any of these values, and they cannot be changed on the
ASI server either.</P>
<H4>Date</H4>
<P>The <I>Date</I> field has two meanings, depending on the version
of the Microsoft AU client. This parameter is machine-independent.</P>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
equal to, or lower than 5.4.3790.21, this date is the file last
modified timestamp of the update installation executable. It can only
be found after an update has been downloaded on the machine. After
download completes, Scrip 237 reports this date to the server.</P>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
higher than 5.4.3790.21, this date is the last deployment changed
date property of an update, retrieved by a COM API call. Scrip 237
reports this date as part of the detection process.</P>
<H4>Platform</H4>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
equal to, or lower than 5.4.3790.21, the value of the <I>Platform</I>
field comes from details.xml. Usually, it's equal to
ver_platform_win32_nt.</P>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
higher than 5.4.3790.21, Scrip 237 reports the <I>Platform</I> field
as blank.</P>
<H4>Component</H4>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
equal to, or lower than 5.4.3790.21, the value of the <I>Component</I>
field comes from details.xml. It specifies the part of the operating
system the software update applies to.</P>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
higher than 5.4.3790.21, Scrip 237 reports the <I>Component</I> field
as blank.</P>
<H4>Priority</H4>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
equal to, or lower than 5.4.3790.21, the value of the <I>Priority</I>
field comes from details.xml. Scrip 237 does not use it.</P>
<P>On machines where the Microsoft AU client iuengine.dll version is
higher than 5.4.3790.21, the <I>Priority</I> field is always 0. Scrip
237 does not use this field.</P>
<P>Please note that Scrip 237 does not use the value of the <I>Priority</I>
field to prioritize the download of software updates, as the
Microsoft AU client does. You have control over both the download and
installation of software update via the Approve updates wizard.</P>
<H4>Uninstallable</H4>
<P>If an uninstall string exists for an update, then the value of the
<I>Uninstallable</I> field is reported as true to the ASI server. The
value of the <I>Uninstallable</I> field is machine independent. Once
any machine installs an update and detects the uninstall string in
the registry, it will set this value to true on the ASI server in the
Microsoft Update Status page on the ASI server. The meaning of the
uninstall string is the same for all versions of the Microsoft AU
client.</P>
