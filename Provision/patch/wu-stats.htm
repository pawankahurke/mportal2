<H3>Search and Display Options Panel Parameters</H3>
<H4>Search Options</H4>
<P>Any field used to filter software update status entries will be
displayed in the software update table. In order to have a field
displayed in the table even if you do not use it as a search
parameter, select the (all) option from its pull down list in the
<FONT COLOR="#000080">Search Options</FONT> panel. If you do not want
a field displayed in the table, simply select (not displayed) from
its pull down list in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Search Options</FONT>
panel.</P>
<P>Dates can only be selected in daily increments up to two weeks
from the current date, weekly increments from two weeks up to one
month, monthly increments from the second month up to six months, and
up to one year beyond six months. You cannot select an end date
different from the current date.</P>
<H5>Name Contains</H5>
<P>In the <I>Name Contains</I> search parameter, you can enter a
single string of alphanumeric characters. The search performed will
be a non-case sensitive sub-string match. Name is the field that
contains the name of a software update.</P>
<H5>Site</H5>
<P>The <I>Site</I> search parameter lets you select software updates
applicable to individual sites.</P>
<H5>Machine</H5>
<P>The <I>Machine</I> search parameter lets you select software
updates applicable to one system. 
</P>
<P>In order to select software update status for a single system you
need to first select the site it belongs to from the <I>Site</I> pull
down list in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Search Options</FONT> panel,
click on the Submit Search button, then select the system whose
update status you are interested in by selecting it from the <I>Machine</I>
pull down list in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Search Options</FONT>
panel.</P>
<H5>Update</H5>
<P><I>Update</I>, e.g. <B>Security Update for Windows 2000 (KB841533)
(x86 en 5.0.2195 SP4.0)</B>, is a name composed of:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The <I>Title</I> of the update (the value of the title field
	in the software update detail information page accessed when you
	click on an Update column entry in the <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Microsoft
	Update &ndash; Status</FONT></FONT> page.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Item</I> string that identifies the software update
	uniquely. The <I>Item</I> string has the following format:</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>processor locale OS Build ServicePack level</B></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in">Initially, newer Microsoft XP software
updates will not have <I>Item</I> string information. Their <I>Item</I>
string will consist of: <B>en 0.0.0 SP0.0</B>. For each software
update, Scrip 237 constructs the <I>Update</I> field composed (<I>Title</I>
plus <I>Item</I> string) and sends it to the ASI server. if the
software update title already exists but the <I>Item</I> string is
different (i.e. if the versions of an update are different) then the
ASI server adds a new software update entry with the same <I>Title</I>
and a different <I>Item</I> string.</P>
<H5>Status</H5>
<P>The <I>Status</I> search parameter lets you select updates by the
value of the status filed as reported by Scrip 237. At present,
values for the <I>Status</I> field include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>automatic</B></P>
	<P>Currently, this state is not used by Scrip 237.</P>
	<LI><P><B>pending install</B></P>
	<LI><P><B>pending uninstall</B></P>
	<LI><P><B>scheduled install</B></P>
	<LI><P><B>scheduled uninistall</B></P>
	<LI><P><B>pending download</B></P>
</UL>
<P>All of the above states indicate the next action Scrip 237 will
take for that software update.</P>
<P>A pending state is when Scrip 237 is just about to perform the
operation, be it downloading, installing, or uninstalling.</P>
<P>A scheduled state is when Scrip 237 needs to wait until a specific
point in time before performing a task. These states are not used
presently since Scrip 237 reports this information in even greater
detail as part of its logs. They're in place in case we need to make
them active at some future date.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Disabled</B></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.51in">A software update has disabled status
when it is declined via the <I>Decline updates</I> wizard on the ASI
server.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>error</B></P>
	<P>When a software update installation fails, its status will change
	to error, last error date will be set to the time Scrip 237
	discovered the failure, and last error text will <B>Update failed to
	install</B>. In future, we will add other error states. For example,
	providing error codes and the corresponding error text.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.51in">Installation errors are the only kind
of error that changes a software update status to <B>error</B>. This
is true for both Microsoft AU clients. The old Microsoft AU client
(iuengine.dll version equal to, or lower than 5.4.3790.21) does not
report the error code explicitly although there may be an error code
in the Windows Update client log output. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.51in">The new Microsoft AU client
(iuengine.dll version higher than 5.4.3790.21) tries to report the
error code explicitly as an hresult. Scrip 237 reports these error
codes in its event logs. You could lookup the meaning of error codes
reported by the Microsoft AU client in a number of sources including
this one: http://inetexplorer.mvps.org/windows_update_codes.htm</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>installed</B></P>
	<P>Scrip 237 reports the software update as successfully installed.</P>
	<LI><P><B>uninstalled</B></P>
	<P>Scrip 237 does not currently use this field.</P>
	<LI><P><B>downloaded</B></P>
	<P>Scrip 237 reports the software update as successfully downloaded.</P>
	<LI><P><B>detected</B></P>
	<P>Scrip 237 reports the software update as detected. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>needs reboot</B></P>
	<P>When a software update is listed as being in this state, the
	system must be restarted before Scrip 237 can take any further
	actions.</P>
	<LI><P><B>potential installation failure</B></P>
	<P>When a software update install operation partially succeeds,
	Scrip 237 will report the software update as having a <B>potential
	installation failure</B> status. Ultimately, this state will be
	followed by either in <B>installed</B> or <B>error</B> state.</P>
	<LI><P><B>superseded</B> 
	</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A software update in <B>superseded</B> state has been
	superseded by another software update, and should not be installed.
	For instance, suppose you decline the installation of Microsoft
	Windows XP SP2, then software updates that were superseded by
	Microsoft XP SP2 are detected by Scrip 237. If Microsoft XP SP2 were
	then approved, those software updates would be given <B>superseded</B>
	status. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.51in">If a software update simply disappears
for any reason, Scrip 237 will assign it a superseded status. A
software update would disappear if at one time Scrip 237 detected it
and reported it to the ASI server, and then during some future
detection cycle the update is not detected again. 
</P>
<H5>Detect Date</H5>
<H5>Download Date</H5>
<H5>Install Date</H5>
<H5>Removal Date</H5>
<H5>Error Date</H5>
<P>The above date related search parameter fields let you select
software updates by the date of the last action performed, or state
detected, by Scrip 237.</P>
<H5>Date of last change</H5>
<P>The <I>Date of last change</I> search parameter facilitates the
search for software update configuration changes that occurred in the
recent past The <I>Date of last change</I> represents the last time a
software update configuration change for a software update occurred
on the ASI server. For example, when the schedule and notification
configuration for a software update was changed, or which systems it
was approved for.</P>
<H5>Date of next action</H5>
<P>Currently, this field is not used by Scrip 237.</P>
<H5>Error</H5>
<P>The <I>Error</I> search parameter lets you select software updates
that have a non-empty error status. Currently, Scrip 237 gives a
software update <B>error</B> status when its installation fails.
Scrip 237 will try to install a software update which has error
status again if it actually exists and it is configured to do so. 
</P>
<H5>Download Source</H5>
<P>The <B>download source</B> search parameter can be either the
Microsoft server or the WUS server (SUS). Usually, it is the full URL
of the server.</P>
<H5>Update Size</H5>
<P>The <I>Update Size</I> search parameter lets you filter updates by
size in the following ranges:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">0 - 100 KB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">100 KB - 500 KB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">500 KB - 1 MB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 MB - 10MB 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">10 MB - 50 MB 
	</P>
	<LI><P>over 50 MB 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that you cannot select updates by size <B>across</B>
the above ranges. For example, you cannot search for updates with
size ranging between 100 Kbytes and 1 Mbyte.</P>
<H5>Machine Group</H5>
<P>You can select either one of the built-in machine groups, a
machine group defined by another user, or a machine group that you
defined when using the software update wizards. Note that if you
select a machine group defined by another user, you cannot modify it.
The ASI built-in machine groups are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>All</B> This category should
	contain only one group, <B>All</B>. The group should contain every
	machine logging to the server. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>Sites</B> This category
	contains one machine group for every site currently logging to the
	server. The site groups have the same name as the site, and each
	site group should contain one member for each machine at the
	associated site. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Machines</B> This category should contain one group for
	each machine currently logging to the server. Each of these groups
	should contain a single machine. The name of the group is
	&quot;$SITE:$HOST&quot; where $SITE represents the site name and
	$HOST represents the machine name. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Note that the <B>All</B> machine group is the default selection
for the <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Microsoft
Update &ndash; Status</FONT></FONT> page. You can select individual
members of the <B>Sites</B> group (i.e. individual sites) using the
<I>Sites</I> search parameter, and individual members of the <B>Machines</B>
group (i.e. individual systems) using the <I>Machines</I> search
parameter.</P>
<H5>Update Group</H5>
<P>The <I>Search Options</I> panel includes the <I>Update Group</I>
selection parameter. Currently, none of the software update wizards
give you the option to define software update groups. The wizards
define software update groups automatically in order to perform
software update tasks. The names of these software update groups,
e.g. <B>Wiz_CRIT_PG $MGRP</B> , are not meaningful to you. The
membership of these software update groups changes every time the
software update task they were created for is executed again. ASI
features a number of built-in software groups:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B>All</B> This patch category
	should contain only one group, <B>All</B>. The group should contain
	every patch known to the server. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Updates</B> This category contains one patch group for
	every patch known to the server. Each group will have the same name
	as its associated patch, and should contain just that one patch. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H5>Type</H5>
<P>The software update <B>type</B> built-in group includes all
Microsoft software update types. The group has the following six
members:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Update</P>
	<LI><P>Service Pack</P>
	<LI><P>Rollup</P>
	<LI><P>Security</P>
	<LI><P>Critical</P>
	<LI><P>Mandatory 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that since the <B>type</B> software update group is
built-in you cannot change it in any way.</P>
<H5>MS Name</H5>
<P><I>MS Name</I>, e.g. <B>841533_W2K_SP5_WinSE_125872</B>, is one of
the names Microsoft gives an update. It's just an entry in the XML
file on the old Microsoft AU client (iuengine.dll version equal to,
or lower than 5.4.3790.21). On the new Microsoft AU client
(iuengine.dll version higher than 5.4.3790.21), this field does not
exist. This means, for example, that new XP patches will not have an
<I>MS Name</I>.</P>
<HR>
<H4>Display Options</H4>
<P>If you want to sort software update table entries by more than one
parameter (e.g. site/machine/update), you should use the Sort-by
options in the <FONT COLOR="#000080">Display Options</FONT> panel. To
sort table entries by a single parameter, simply click on the column
heading corresponding to that parameter (e.g. Status). Clicking once
sorts entries in descending order, twice sorts them in ascending
order.</P>
<P>You can control the number of entries displayed in an item page
with the Page Size parameter. Its possible values are listed below.</P>
<P><B>5 10 20 25 50 75 100 150 200 250 500 750 1000</B>
