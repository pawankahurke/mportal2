You can create advanced searches by
writing conditional statements like
this:

    (#text# LIKE '%access%') AND (#text# NOT LIKE '%microsoft access%')

Where:

    #text# -- represents the text in the database

Operators:

    AND  -- logical AND
    OR   -- logical OR
    NOT  -- negation operator used with LIKE
    LIKE -- similar to '=' but you can use the wildcard character
    =    -- equal to (exact match--no wildcards!)
    !=   -- not equal to (exact match--no wildcards!)

The wildcard character is '%'
