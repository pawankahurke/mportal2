<img border="0" src="img/keys.gif" height="18" width="17">&nbsp;&nbsp;A
<b>BaseKey</b> contains the beginning portion of the Key name.<br><br>

<ol>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Root Key</b> is the first part of the key name.
These are defined in Windows and can be selected from a pulldown
menu in the "Base keys" wizard.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sub Key</b> is the second part of the key name.
This is a key name that the user can edit, and determines the scope
of this base key.

</ol><br><br>

<img border="0" id=4 src="img/filter.gif" height="18"
width="17">&nbsp;&nbsp;A <b>Filter</b> selects a registry key for
taking action.<br><br>

<ol>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>Filter Type</b> controls which registry types
are affected by an action.  The user may choose to only affect
registry keys or to affect both keys and values.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Base Key</b> indicates which base key is used as
the starting point for the affected key name.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Key</b> is appended to the base key to give the
key name.  The entire key name is therefore composed of the root key
(from the base key), followed by the sub key (from the base key),
followed by the key.  The key must start with a backslash ("\").

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Key Wild</b> indicates that the key name is treated
as a wildcard, so a question mark ("?") matches a single character and an
asterisk ("*") matches any number of characters.  For example, with:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Root key = HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub key = Software<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key = \Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>U*</b><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both these keys would be affected:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>U</b>RL<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>U</b>ninstall<br>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Name</b> selects affected values based on
their name.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Name Wild</b> works like "Key Wild" but
applies to the value name.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Type</b> selects affected values based on
their data type.  The available data types are selected from a list
in a pulldown menu.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Data</b> selects affected values based on
the data they contain.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Data Wild</b> works like "Key Wild" but
applies to the value data.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Global</b> indicates that all users have access
to a filter.  This option is only available to administrative users
and can only be changed by the user that created the filter.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Recursive</b> indicates that the filter applies
to all keys under the selected keys as well as the selected keys
themselves.

</ol><br><br>

<img border="0" src="img/arrow.gif" height="18"
width="17">&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Action</b> allows the user to take action
on the selected attribute.  For example:<br><br>

<ol>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;selecting the action button next to a base key shows
all the actions that apply to that base key.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;selecting the action button next to a machine shows
all the actions that apply to that machine.  For example, if a user
selects <b>List Action</b>, then they would be prompted with:

<ol type="a">

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A pull down box of filters to choose from.  A list of
keys is generated using those that are selected by the chosen filter.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Max Affected</b> specifies a limit on the
number of registry keys that will be affected by this action.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Clear</b> indicates that any existing values for
this registry key will be cleared and replaced with the data from the
registry; otherwise, the data from the registry is cumulative.
