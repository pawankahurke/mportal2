<table><IMG border=0 id=5 src="keys.gif" style="HEIGHT: 18px; WIDTH: 17px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;A <b>BaseKey</b> contains the beginning portion of the Key name.  For Example:<br><br>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Root Key</b> is the first part of the Key name.  These are defined in windows and can be selected from a pull down menu in the BaseKeys wizard.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sub Key</b> is the second part of the Key name.  This is a part of the Key name that the user can edit and is dependent on the desired range of this BaseKey.<br>

<table><IMG border=0 id=4 src="usetools.gif" style="HEIGHT: 18px; WIDTH: 17px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;A <b>Filter</b> contains the attributes of the Registry Key the user wants to take an action with. For Example:<br><br>
<ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <b>Filter Type</b> is what controls the kind of Registry Types effected by an action.  The user may choose either to only effect Registry Keys or to effect both Keys and Values.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>BaseKey</b> Name links this Filter to a previosly made BaseKey which will give the user a starting point for the Key that is intended on being effected.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Key</b> is the last portion of then Key Name.  This when linked together as shown  (Root Key\Sub Key\Key) forms the starting point at which any Registry Key that has this string as a hierarchy of it will be effected. Key Must be started with a \<br>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Key Wild</b> when sellected,  allows the user to input a Key and the scrip will find all Keys that this Value Name is a subset of. For Example:<br>
<ol>&nbsp;&nbsp;Key =   (\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>U</b>)<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;the scrip would return both,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>U</b>RL) <BR> AND <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\<b>U</b>ninstall)<br>
</ol><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Name</b> is the part of the Filter that will allow the user to specify a single Value found in the Key to take an action upon.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Name Wild</b> is just like the Key Wild but applies for Value Name.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Type</b> allows the user to specify there search by types of Values in the Registry.  These are defined in windows so they are represented as a pull down menu.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Data</b> allows the user to specify there search by types of Value Data in the Registry.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Value Name Wild</b> is just like the Key Wild but applies for Value Name.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Globald</b> field is only allowed to admin users. This will allow those users to make a Filter that will appear in all users LeftPane as a Filter.  These Global Filters can only be edited by the user who created it.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Recursive</b> field allowed users to specify a Key but then to have the action that they want to take upon that Key also apply for any Keys that are under it in the hierarchy.<br>

<table><IMG border=0 id=11 src="arrow.gif" style="HEIGHT: 18px; WIDTH: 17px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Action</b> in the general sense will allow the user to take action on the selected attribute. For Example:<br><br>
<ol><li> &nbsp;&nbsp;an user selected the action button  adjacent to a BaseKey then the RightPane  would get populated with all Actions that apply to that BaseKey.<br><li> &nbsp;&nbsp;the user selected the action button  adjacent to a Machine then the RightPane  would get populated with all Actions that apply to that Machine. For Example:<br>
<ol> &nbsp;&nbsp;the user then selected the <b>List Action. </b> Then they would be prompted with:<br>
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp;A pull down box of all the Filters that  they own to select from.  If the user selected 'FilterA' a List would be  generated from the Registry Keys that  apply to information from FilterA.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A <b> Max Effected </b> box that will limit the amount of Registry Keys effected by this Action.<br><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;A <b> Clear </b> check box that will clear all values our of the database before returning any values from this Action.<br></li>

<table><IMG border=0 id=2 src="settings.jpg" style="HEIGHT: 18px; WIDTH: 17px" >&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Settings</b> control some visual settings of the LeftPane. For Example:<br><br>
<ol><li> &nbsp;&nbsp;the user where to select the <b> Restore Factory Settings </b> link then all the information that is used to generate the LeftPane would be deleted and it would appear as it did the very first time a user browsed to the Registry Manager.  This is a fail safe device that should be used if the Database where to become corrupt.<br>
