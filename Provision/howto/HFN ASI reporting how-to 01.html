</H4>
<P>1) Set up a <A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20user%20management%20how-to%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">new
user</A> (via the admin module) with access only to the site(s) you
want the new user to be able to access (with &quot;Normal&quot;
privileges, and no additional rights). 
</P>
<P>a) Log onto your ASI server (https://asiservername/main)</P>
<P>b) Click on the &quot;Use extended interface&quot; link on the
right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and
date.</P>
<P>c) In the &quot;tools&quot; navigation bar, click on the &quot;admin&quot;
link.</P>
<P>d) Click on the &quot;new user&quot; link located above the table
listing users defined on the ASI server.</P>
<P>e) Fill in &quot;name&quot; (eg. acme), &quot;password&quot;, and
&quot;confirm&quot; fields.</P>
<P>f) In the &quot;Notify mail&quot;, and &quot;Report mail&quot;
fields enter the e-mail address of the notification and report
recipient(s). 
</P>
<P>g) In the &quot;Sites&quot; list, click on the entry for the site
you want the new user to have access to. If you want to select more
than one site, press the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key and click the mouse on
the entry for each site you want the new user to have access to.</P>
<P>h) Click on the &quot;Create&quot; button at the bottom of the
page.</P>
<P>After you have created a user following the above steps, all
enabled global reports (both event and asset, legacy and non-legacy),
and global event notifications, when executed as per their schedule,
will run for each user covering only the sites accessible to that
user.</P>
<P>2) You can also produce a report (asset or event), and event
notification covering one or more sites by configuring a report (or
notification) to cover only selected sites. The following steps
describe this procedure for a legacy event report. The steps for
defining an asset report, event notification, asset or event sections
covering one or more sites are the same except for the fact that you
would perform them on the &quot;Asset Reports&quot;, &quot;Event
Notifications&quot;, &ldquo;Sections&rdquo; pages respectively.</P>
<P>a) Log onto your ASI server (https://asiservername/main)</P>
<P>b) Click on the &quot;Use extended interface&quot; link on the
right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and
date.</P>
<P>c) Click on the &ldquo;legacy reports&rdquo; link in the &ldquo;reports&rdquo;
navigation bar found the at upper right-hand corner of any page in
the ASI server extended interface. The &ldquo;Legacy Reports&rdquo;
page will be displayed.</P>

links:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>&ldquo;Legacy event reports&rdquo;. Click on this link to
	access the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; event reports page at
	https://asiservername/main/event/report.php 
	</P>
	<LI><P>&ldquo;Legacy asset reports&rdquo;. Click on this link to
	access the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; asset reports page at
	https://asiservername/main/asset/report.php 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Click on the &quot;Legacy event reports&quot; link. The
	&quot;Event Reports&quot; page will be displayed.</P>
</UL>
<P>e) Retrieve the report you want to configure to cover one or more
site:</P>

Options&quot; panel enter one or more words from the report title,
and click on the &quot;Search&quot; button.</P>
<P>f) Scroll down to the entry for the report you want to configure

at its scheduled time, or on-demand when you click on the &ldquo;run&rdquo;
link to the left of the report name in its entry on the &ldquo;Event
Reports&rdquo; page. In the case of an asset report, you would do the
same on the &ldquo;Asset Reports&rdquo; page, accessed as described
in steps c) and d) above.</P>
<P>Please also note that if you decided to change the schedule of the
new report to type &ldquo;Immediate&rdquo; (and selected a period for
the report to cover), once the report (event or asset) runs, it will
be automatically deleted.</P>

</H4>
<P>Suppose you want to run an event report covering the period from
July 1, 2006 until August 15, 2006, then you would:</P>
<P>1) Log onto your ASI server (https://asiservername/main)</P>
<P>2) Click on the &quot;Use extended interface&quot; link on the
right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and
date.</P>
<P>3) Click on the &ldquo;legacy reports&rdquo; link in the &ldquo;reports&rdquo;
navigation bar found the at upper right-hand corner of any page in
the ASI server extended interface. The &ldquo;Legacy Reports&rdquo;
page will be displayed.</P>
<P>4) In the The &ldquo;Legacy Reports&rdquo; page, you will find two
links:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>&ldquo;Legacy event reports&rdquo;. Click on this link to
	access the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; event reports page at
	https://asiservername/main/event/report.php 
	</P>
	<LI><P>&ldquo;Legacy asset reports&rdquo;. Click on this link to
	access the &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; asset reports page at
	https://asiservername/main/asset/report.php 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Click on the &quot;Legacy event reports&quot; link. The
	&quot;Event Reports&quot; page will be displayed.</P>
</UL>
<P>5) Retrieve the report you want to run immediately:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>In the &quot;Name Contains&quot; field in the &quot;Search
	Options&quot; panel enter one or more words from the report title,
	and click on the &quot;Search&quot; button.</P>
</UL>
<P>6) Scroll down to the entry for the report you want to run
immediately, and click on the &quot;copy&quot; link to the left of
the report entry. 
</P>
<P>7) Change the report title entered in the &quot;Report title&quot;
field, as desired.</P>
<P>8) Scroll down to the &quot;Schedule&quot; area of the report
configuration page,on the lower right-hand side of the page</P>
<P>9) Select &quot;Immediate&quot; from the &quot;Report cycle&quot;
drop-down list.</P>
<P>10) Enter 07/01/06 in the &quot;Start date&quot; field</P>
<P>11) Enter 08/16/06 in the &quot;End date&quot; field</P>
<P>12) Enable the report by selecting &quot;Yes&quot; from the
&quot;Enabled&quot; configuration parameter pull-down list, if
necessary.</P>
<P>13) Click on the &quot;Add&quot; button at the bottom of the page
(left side)</P>
<P>The report will be produced within the next 5-15 minutes (on
average). As soon as it is produced, its entry in the &quot;Event
Reports&quot; page will be deleted. This is why you make a copy of
the report that you want to run immediately (by changing its &quot;Report
cycle&quot; to &quot;Immediate&quot;).</P>
<P>Alternatively, if the reporting cycle of a report covers the
period you want (i.e. the period you want a report to cover is the
past month and its &quot;Report cycle&quot; is monthly), then all you
need to do is perform steps 1) to 3) described above, and then click
on the &quot;run&quot; link to the left of a report's entry. The
report will run covering the past X days where X is equal to its
reporting cycle. When run immediately in this way, an event report's
entry in the &quot;Event Reports&quot; page will not be deleted.
Please also note that running an event report via the &quot;run&quot;
link works even in the case of reports that are disabled.</P>
<P>Please note that you can follow the procedure described above to
produce an asset report immediately. Instead of accessing the &quot;Event
Reports&quot; page, you would go to the &quot;Asset Reports&quot;
page, accessed as described in steps 3) and 4) above..</P>
