<H3>How-to Manage MS Windows Services Using the Automated Support
Infrastructure Service Management Console</H3>
<H4>Overview</H4>
<P>Automated Support Infrastructure (ASI) service management is the
first and only remote service management facility that lets users
manage MS Windows services on any number of systems, simultaneously,
regardless of their location.</P>
<P>The ASI service management function duplicates the Microsoft
Windows service management function. It lets you start, stop,
re-start, enable, disable, and change service type from manual to
automatic, and vice versa.</P>
<P>ASI service management includes two major functions not supported
by the Microsoft Windows service management function:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>You can manage services on multiple systems at the same time,
	remotely, regardless of their location. You can perform any action
	on one or more services on any number of systems simultaneously.</P>
	<LI><P>You can configure a service to always be kept running, or
	never be allowed to run.</P>
</UL>
<P>In addition to being a powerful system management tool, the ASI
service management function provides you with comprehensive
information on all services defined on a system, not just those
enabled or disabled, and updates this information in real-time.</P>
<H4>Enabling the ASI service management function</H4>
<P>Before you can start managing MS Windows services on systems at
your sites, you need to enable Scrip 224 (MS Windows Service Manager)
on the systems where you want to manage MS Windows services.</P>
<P>Scrip 224 can run in polling or event driven mode.</P>
<P>In polling mode, the Scrip runs at a scheduled time at which he
surveys MS Windows services on a system, and reports all MS Windows
service information to the ASI server.</P>
<P>In event-driven mode, Scrip execution is triggered in real-time by
any MS Windows service change.</P>
<P>Please note that when running in event-driven mode, Scrip 224 will
tend to run more frequently, accessing the ASI server more
frequently.</P>
<P>Scrip 224 performs actions you configured on the MS Windows
services console on the ASI server when:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>An MS Windows service related change on the system causes the
	Scrip to contact the ASI server</P>
	<LI><P>Scrip 224 runs at its scheduled time</P>
</UL>
<H4>Accessing the ASI service management console</H4>
<P>You can access all MS Windows services information collected by
Scrip 224 (MS Windows Service Manager) via the ASI service management
console. In order to access the ASI service management console,
please perform the following steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Log onto your ASI server (<A HREF="https://asiservername/main">https://asiservername/main</A>).
	The ASI dashboard will be displayed.</P>
	<LI><P>If you want to manage MS Windows services, or access MS
	Windows service information on one system:</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><P>If the &ldquo;Sites&rdquo; item in the left pane of the ASI
		Dashboard is not expanded, click on the &quot;+&quot; icon to the
		left of the &ldquo;Sites&rdquo; label to display entries for all
		sites on your ASI server</P>
		<LI><P>Scroll down the left pane to the site where the system whose
		MS Windows services you want to manage or review</P>
		<LI><P>Expand the entry for the site where the system is located
		(click on the &quot;+&quot; icon to the left of the site name)</P>
		<LI><P>Click on the name of the system where you want to manage or
		review MS Windows services</P>
		<LI><P>In the right pane, click on the &quot;services&quot; link in
		the list of links at the top of the pane. The services management
		console for the system will be displayed in the left pane.</P>
	</OL>
	<LI><P>If you want to manage MS Windows services, or access MS
	Windows service information for a group of systems:</P>
	<OL>
		<LI><P>If the &ldquo;Groups&rdquo; item in the left pane of the ASI
		Dashboard is not expanded, click on the &quot;+&quot; icon to the
		left of the &ldquo;Groups&rdquo; label to display entries for all
		groups defined on your ASI server</P>
		<LI><P>Scroll down the left pane to the entry for the group of
		systems where where you want to manage or review MS Windows
		services</P>
		<LI><P>Click on the name of the group.</P>
		<LI><P>In the right pane, click on the &quot;services&quot; link in
		the list of links at the top of the pane.</P>
	</OL>
</OL>
<H4>Taking service management actions</H4>
<P>At present, the ASI service management function supports the
following service related actions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Start - Starts the service only if it's not running, does
	nothing otherwise.</P>
	<LI><P>Stop - Stops a service if it is running, does nothing
	otherwise</P>
	<LI><P>Restart - If a service is running, it stops and starts it. If
	a service is stopped, it starts it.</P>
</UL>
<P>To take any of the above actions for a service on a system, a
site, or a group of systems you defined, simply click on the link
corresponding to the action you want to take. After you take an
action, a message asking for confirmation of the action will be
displayed in the right pane, followed by an action confirmation
message also displayed in the right pane. Clicking on the &ldquo;Done&rdquo;
button on the confirmation page will take you back to the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;
page for the system or group you took the action on.</P>
<H5>Advanced service management</H5>
<P>If you want to configure settings for a service, you should click
on the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; link for a service. When you do that,
the &ldquo;Service settings to be configured on machine &lt;machine
name&gt; in group &lt;group or machine name&gt;&rdquo; page will be
displayed in the right pane.</P>
<P>You can make two types of service configuration setting changes:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Service status</P>
	<LI><P>Keep service running &ndash; If you choose this option, Scrip
	224 (MS Windows Service Manager) will ensure that the service will
	run at all times, automatically re-starting it if it stops.</P>
	<LI><P>Keep service stopped &ndash; If you choose this option, Scrip
	224 (MS Windows Service Manager) will ensure that the service will
	not run, automatically stopping it if it attempts to start.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Startup type</P>
	<UL>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Automatic &ndash; When you select this option, Scrip 224
			(MS Windows Service Manager) will set the service type on the
			system, or group of systems, to &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;</P>
			<LI><P>Manual &ndash; When you select this option, Scrip 224 (MS
			Windows Service Manager) will set the service type on the system,
			or group of systems, to &ldquo;manual&rdquo;</P>
			<LI><P>Disabled &ndash; When you select this option, Scrip 224 (MS
			Windows Service Manager) will set the service type on the system,
			or group of systems, to &ldquo;disabled&rdquo;</P>
		</UL>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.51in">Please note that you can configure
&ldquo;service status&rdquo; and &ldquo;startup type&rdquo; settings
at the same time.</P>
<P>To select a setting for a service on a system, a site, or a group
of systems you defined, simply click on the radio button
corresponding to the desired setting. Clicking on the &ldquo;Update&rdquo;
button will cause the content of the &ldquo;Current Settings&rdquo;
window to be updated with the changes you just made. Clicking on the
&ldquo;Done&rdquo; button will take you back to the &ldquo;Services
information&rdquo; page. Please note that you do not have to click on
the &ldquo;Update&rdquo; button. Clicking on the &ldquo;Done&rdquo;
button will both update the settings and take you back to the
&ldquo;Services information&rdquo; page.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>After you access the ASI service management console as described
in the &ldquo;Accessing the ASI service management console&rdquo;
section of this document, you can take any of the actions described
above by clicking on the corresponding action link the MS Windows
service you want to take the action on. In order to access &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;
functions, you need to click on the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; action
link.</P>
<H4><I>Notes</I></H4>
<P><I>When taking a service management action on a group of systems,
the service management software running on the ASI server doesn't
determine which systems in the group the action applies to. Scrip 224
(MS Windows Service Manager) on the systems in the group retrieves
the action, and attempts to perform the action. The Scrip doesn't
check the status of the service before it attempts to perform the
action. If the action does not apply, nothing will happen.</I></P>
<P><I>The ASI MS Windows service management function does not replace
Scrip 227 (Process and Service Shutdown-restart). Scrip 227 can run
periodically to take a shut-down or re-start action on one or more MS
Windows services while the ASI MS Windows service management function
lets you take one-time actions.</I></P>
<P><I>Until we integrate the ASI event notification function with the
ASI dashboard, you should continue to use Scrip 176 (Services
Restart) to monitor MS Windows services otherwise you won't receive
e-mail notifications when monitored services stop running. However,
you can stop using the &quot;restart&quot; option in Scrip 176 and,
instead, use the &quot;Services Status&quot; setting in the new MS
Windows service management function. </I>
