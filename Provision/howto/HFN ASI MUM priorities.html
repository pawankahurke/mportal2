<H3>ASI Microsoft Update Management Priorities</H3>
<P>Within ASI Microsoft Update Management (MUM) priorities are
assigned to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Machines categories (machine groups are members of machine
	categories)</P>
	<LI><P>Software update categories (software update groups are
	members of software update categories)</P>
</UL>
<H4><A NAME="mumconfigurationsettings"></A>MUM configuration settings
</H4>
<P>MUM configuration settings are partitioned between machine and
software update groups as follows:</P>
<H5>Software update group configuration settings</H5>
<P>Software update configurations include those settings that let you
control how MUM should handle a software update, specifically:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Approve/decline status</P>
	<LI><P>Schedule</P>
	<LI><P>Notification</P>
</UL>
<H5>Machine group configuration settings</H5>
<P>Machine configurations include those settings that let you control
the software update process on a system, specifically:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Source of updates</P>
	<LI><P>Management (e.g. disabled, managed from ASI client, or
	managed from ASI server (the default setting))</P>
	<LI><P>How new software updates should be handled (i.e. use last
	settings from ASI server (the default setting), or get updated
	settings from ASI server before taking action)</P>
	<LI><P>Download policy (default setting - Try to retrieve from local
	machines, then download from vendor if unsuccessful)</P>
	<LI><P>Retention policy (default setting - Keep updates on this
	machine for 14 days, for other machines to use)</P>
	<LI><P>Restart policy (default setting - Automatically restart when
	a restart is necessary after an installation)</P>
	<LI><P>Multiple installations (default setting - Repeat install
	cycle until machine is up to date, but stop after 1 hour)</P>
</UL>
<H4>Built-in ASI machine categories</H4>
<P>ASI features the following built-in machine categories:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><I>All</I> which has the lowest priority (1 is lowest). It
	has only one group. The All machine group</P>
	<LI><P><I>User</I> which has the second lowest priority. Every user
	defined on an ASI server has a corresponding group in this category
	containing all the systems in sites to which a user has access. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Site</I> which has the second highest priority. Every site
	on an ASI server, and in which Scrip 237 (Microsoft Update
	Management) is enabled on at least one system, has a corresponding
	group in this category.</P>
	<LI><P><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A><I>Machine</I>, which has the highest
	priority. Every system whose ASI client has logged to an ASI server,
	and on which Scrip 237 is enabled, has a corresponding group in this
	category, made up of itself only. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>Machine configurations</H4>
<H5>Default machine configurations</H5>
<P>By default, MUM assigns a machine configuration <B>ONLY</B> to the
<I>All</I> machine group which, as its name implies, includes all
systems at all sites. MUM automatically assigns the configuration of
the first lower priority machine group with a configuration to any
machine group which does not have a configuration. This means that by
default, systems in all other groups, have the MUM configuration
assigned to the <I>All</I> machine group. 
</P>
<P><B>Please note that unless necessary, you should not add a machine
configuration for a group. Keep in mind that any machine
configuration you add will have the same priority as the group it is
defined for.</B></P>
<H5>User defined machine configurations</H5>
<P>Once you add a configuration to a machine group, for the systems
in the machine group it supersedes the <I>All</I> machine group MUM
configuration.</P>
<P>For systems that belong to multiple groups the machine
configuration of the group with higher priority will apply. To add a
machine configuration to a group follow these links:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>microsoft update</B> navigation
bar: click on the <I>advanced</I> link &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the
<I>config</I> link in the second-level navigation bar labeled
<B>configuration</B> &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the <I>Machine
configuration</I> link in the body of the page &gt;&gt;&gt; Click on
the <I>add</I> link in the link entries at the top of the page under
the title.</P>
<P>Please note that you <B>CANNOT</B> add machine groups to built-in
machine categories.</P>
<P>You can add new groups either via the <I>Add new group</I>
function in the group management page on your ASI server
(<A HREF="https://asiserverurl/main/config/groups.php?custom=3">https://asiserverurl/main/config/groups.php?custom=3</A>
), or by first defining new categories via the advanced group
management interface (clicking on the advanced link on the group
management page on your ASI server), and then defining groups within
the new categories. 
</P>
<P>By default, A user defined category is assigned a priority that is
higher than <I>Site</I>, <I>User</I>, and <I>All</I> category groups
but lower than <I>Machine</I> category groups. You can change this
default behavior, by changing the value of the <I>override_sites</I>
configuration parameter in your ASI server's configuration from <B>1</B>
(its default value) to <B>0</B>. After you make this change, any
group you define (which will be placed in a user defined group
category) will have a priority lower than <I>machine</I> and <I>sites</I>
category groups but higher than <I>user</I> and <I>All</I> category
groups .</P>
<P><B>Please remember that by default, MUM assigns the machine
configuration of the <I>All</I> machine group to all user defined
machine groups.</B></P>
<P>When a system is in two (or more) user defined groups that are in
the same category, and the MUM machine group configuration settings
for the two user defined groups are different, the MUM software on
the ASI server uses the machine configuration settings from the most
recently-created group.</P>
<P>You can change the priority of machine categories by following
these links:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>microsoft update</B> navigation
bar: click on the <I>advanced</I> link &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the
<I>config</I> link in the second-level navigation bar labeled
<B>configuration</B> &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the <I>Machine groups</I>
link in the body of the page &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the <I>move up</I>
and <I>move down</I> links in the <I>Action</I> entries for the
machine category whose priority you want to change.</P>
<P>When you define machine groups while performing an MUM wizard
action, those user defined groups (e.g. the <I>server</I> group
defined while using the <I>Select update method</I> wizard to assign
a manual software update method to servers at all sites) are placed
in a built-in category called <I>Wiz_SCOP_MC</I>.</P>
<P>By default, machine groups in the <I>Wiz_SCOP_MC</I> category have
the same priority as other user defined groups, higher than the <I>All</I>,
<I>User</I>, and <I>Site</I> built-in machine category groups, but
lower than <I>Machine</I> category groups. Please note that you can
raise the priority of the <I>Wiz_SCOP_MC</I> category as described
above.</P>
<P><B>THE KEY POINT IS THAT AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT DEFINE MUM
CONFIGURATIONS FOR GROUPS OUTSIDE OF THE <I>ALL</I> MACHINE GROUP,
CONFIGURATIONS FOR ALL MACHINE GROUPS ARE EQUAL TO THAT OF THE <I>ALL</I>
MACHINE GROUP, REGARDLESS OF THE PRIORITIES OF THE VARIOUS MACHINE
GROUPS. </B>
</P>
<H4>Built-in software update categories</H4>
<P>There are two built-in software update categories:</P>
<P>- All which has the lowest priority (1). It contains contains all
of the software updates</P>
<P>- Update which has the highest priority. It contains a group for
each software update that contains only that update</P>
<H4>Software update configurations</H4>
<P>By default,MUM assigns a software update configuration <B>ONLY</B>
to systems in the <I>All</I> software update group. MUM automatically
assigns the configuration of the first lower priority software update
group with a configuration to any software update group which does
not have a configuration. This means that by default, software
updates in all other groups, have the MUM configuration assigned to
the All software update group. 
</P>
<P>When you run the <I>Approve updates</I>, <I>Decline updates</I>,
<I>Remove updates</I>, and <I>Install critical updates</I> wizards,
the entries for the software updates you select for each action are
stored in groups contained in the following four built-in software
update categories, listed in order of <B>increasing</B> priority:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Wiz_APPR_PC</P>
	<LI><P>Wiz_DECL_PC</P>
	<LI><P>Wiz_REMV_PC</P>
	<LI><P>Wiz_CRIT_PC. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>All four built-in software update categories listed above have
higher priority than the <I>All</I> and <I>Update</I> software update
categories listed in the <I>Built-in software update categories</I>
section of this document.</P>
<P>The rationale behind this is that decline should override approve,
so that you can approve software updates, and then decline them just
on systems where they would cause problems. Software update removal
actions have to override both, because you are explicitly
uninstalling a software update that may have already been approved,
and even declined, once you discovered a problem. Installation of
critical software updates overrides all other actions because you are
installing a software update that has to be installed so the action
has to be performed, overriding any other outstanding actions.</P>
<H4>Machine and software update priorities &ndash; which ones apply?</H4>
<P>As you can see from the above, within MUM there are two sets of
priorities: Those for machine categories and those for software
update categories. The way to keep the differences, and impact of
both straight is to ask the following question about any particular
setting:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Does it affect a SYSTEM, or does it
affect a SOFTWARE UPDATE (Please refer to the <A HREF="#mumconfigurationsettings"><I>MUM
configuration settings</I></A> section of this document for a listing
of MUM configuration parameters applicable to machine and software
update groups)? 
</P>
<P>The answer to this question will tell you where the priority will
be resolved.</P>
<P>The connection between machine groups and software update groups
is displayed on the <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Software
Update Configurations for Microsoft Update</FONT></FONT> page which
you get to by following these links: 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>microsoft update</B> navigation
bar: click on the <I>advanced</I> link &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the
<I>config</I> link in the second-level navigation bar labeled
<B>configuration</B> &gt;&gt;&gt; click on the <I>Software update
configuration</I> link in the body of the page</P>
<P>The <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Software
Update Configurations for Microsoft Update</FONT></FONT> page lists
software update groups in order of increasing priority. Each entry on
this page lists a software update group and the machine group it
applies to. Note that a software update group can be applied to more
than one machine group. This should make the precedence of settings
fairly clear.</P>
<P>For example, if in the <FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><FONT COLOR="#000080">Software
Update Configurations for Microsoft Update</FONT></FONT> page you
have:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Two entries for the <I>All</I> software update group, one
	applied to machine group <I>All</I>, and the other to user defined
	group ABC in user defined category XYZ</P>
	<LI><P>Two entries for the <I>Wiz_APPR_PC</I> software update group
	applied to machine groups ABC in user defined category XYZ, and DEF
	in the <I>Wiz_SCOP_MC</I> machine category</P>
	<P>and</P>
	<LI><P>No machine group configuration has been defined (or edited)
	<B>except</B> for the default <I>All</I> machine group configuration</P>
</UL>
<P>Then, the MUM software update configuration settings of the
<I>Wiz_APPR_PC</I> software update group are applied to software
updates installed on the ABC and DEF machine group, and the <I>All</I>
machine group configuration settings are applied to the ABC and DEF
machine groups since the <I>All</I> machine group is the ONLY machine
group with defined MUM machine configuration settings.</P>
<P>Now suppose a machine group configuration has been defined for
site ACME, and three systems from site ACME are included in group
ABC. The three systems in group ABC which are also part of site ACME
will have the machine configuration assigned to systems in site ACME
because the priority of the <I>Site</I> machine category is higher
than the priority of the <I>All</I> machine group, and machine group
ABC has the same machine configuration as the <I>All</I> machine
group since one of its own has not been defined.</P>
<P><B>A system will always have the machine configuration of the
highest priority group it belongs to for which a machine
configuration has been defined.</B></P>
