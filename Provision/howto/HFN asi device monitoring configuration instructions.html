</P>
<P>This document outlines the use of the Automated Support
Infrastructure (ASI) to monitor device availability. 
</P>
<P>A system running the ASI client software can use Scrip 88 (<I>Network
Devices and Services Availability</I>) to test the availability of
any device that will respond to ping, or to a TCP packet sent to a
specified port. A notification can be emailed when any device fails
to respond. 
</P>
<P>You can also use Scrip 231 (<I>Client Heartbeat</I>) to monitor
the availability of any device running the ASI client. The advantages
of using Scrip 231 to monitor device availability are</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>No configuration is required, except optionally to increase
	the Scrip's execution frequency. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>No IP ports need to be open for incoming communication at
	your customer sites</P>
	<LI><P>No device at your customer sites needs to have a fixed IP
	address, or resolvable URL</P>
</UL>
<P>The disadvantage of using Scrip 231 is that it may generate false
alarms when the ASI client on a device you want to monitor using
Scrip 231 is down but the device itself is not down. This is possible
because Scrip 231 monitors the availability of the ASI client, and in
some cases, the ASI client may be down while the device it runs on
may not.</P>
<H4><A NAME="devmonstrategies"></A>Device monitoring strategies<A HREF="#top">
<FONT SIZE=1><FONT FACE="Wingdings">&aacute;</FONT>top </FONT></A>
</H4>
<P>In the simplest case, the ASI ASI client is configured on one
machine which tests the availability of other devices. It is not
required that the devices to be tested run the ASI ASI client. The
only requirement is that they can be reached from the system where
the ASI ASI client runs (by NetBIOS name, URL, or by IP address) and
will respond to ping or to a TCP packet. Monitoring can be made more
robust by implementing a redundancy scheme. For example, suppose the
ASI ASI client is running on Machine1, Machine2 and Machine3.
Machine1 could test Machine2 and Machine3; Machine2 could test
Machine1 and Machine3; and Machine3 would be set up to test Machine1
and Machine2. Each of these machines could also test the availability
of other machines, whether or not those machines are running the ASI
ASI client. 
</P>
<P>In general, you should have at least two, bot no more than three
devices monitor the availability of an IP device or IP service.</P>
<P>Typically, you will be able to use ping (ICMP) to test the
availability of devices inside a private network. When testing the
availability of devices outside a private network, in all likelihood
you will have to test the availability of a TCP service (a port). For
example, if you want to test the availability of the gateways and
firewalls at a number of sites from your location, you will need to
configure Scrip 88 on the ASI client on one ore more systems at your
location to test the availability of TCP services such as HTTP (port
80) or SMTP (port 25) on gateways, and a port such as 3389 (Microsoft
Remote Display Protocol (Terminal Server)) on the firewalls.</P>
<P>It is unlikely that the same ports will be open for incoming
traffic on all gateways and firewalls at your customer sites. You
will have to determine which ports are open on a case-by-case basis.
In some cases, you may have to open one port for incoming traffic if
you want to use Scrip 88 on systems at your location to test the
availability of gateways and firewalls at your customer sites. If
this is not possible, or if the gateways and/or firewalls at some
sites do not have a static IP address of dynamic DNS URL, you will
need to use Scrip 231 (Client Heartbeat) as the sole way to alert you
about the loss of connectivity at your customer sites.</P>
<P>Whenever possible, you should avoid using IP addresses to identify
devices to be tested devices that test the availability of other
devices (testers). This is for two main reasons:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Most environments are configured to use DHCP. If you used IP
	addresses to identify tester devices or devices to be tested, you
	will need to update the configuration of Scrip 88 whenever IP
	addresses change.</P>
	<LI><P>Identifying devices to be tested and tester devices by their
	URL or NetBIOS name makes them more easily recognizable.</P>
</UL>
<P>Depending on the criticality of the device being monitored, The
frequency of execution of Scrip 88 should be increased from its
default of one and 31 minutes past the hour, every hour. However,
typically it should not be necessary to run the Scrip more frequently
than three minutes per hour.</P>

Scrip 88, it will retrieve the Scrip 88 configuration changes. 
</P>
<P><B>Please keep in mind that if you have not changed the Scrip 177
execution schedule, by default it runs at 0 minutes past the hour

<P>If you are using one machine to do all the monitoring, you're done
with Scrip configuration and you should proceed to the next section
on configuring the event notification. To configure an additional
machine to perform monitoring tests, click the <B>Sites:
Configuration</B> link which appears near the top of the page. This
brings you back to the page where sites are listed, and you can
repeat the Scrip configuration process for another machine. To
increase reliability by building redundancy into the monitoring
scheme, you can set up the machines to be tested on each ASI client's
Scrip 88 configuration, as in this example:

<P>For example, in order to monitor the availability of the ASI
server applications on all ASI servers, we selected a system at one
of our internal sites, and followed the steps described below. 
</P>
<P>In order to use Scrip 100 to monitor Web based applications at

<FONT SIZE=1><FONT FACE="Wingdings">&aacute;</FONT>top </FONT></A>
</H4>
<P>In addition to monitoring IP devices and services, and Web
applications, with ASI you can automate MS Windows services
monitoring and, optionally, have Scrip 176 (<I>Services Restart</I>)
automatically attempt to re-start services which stopped running</P>
<P>Before configuring Scrip 176, you should collect the display names
of all MS Windows services you want to monitor on all systems, at all
sites. Because Scrip 176 will ignore services that it may be
configured to monitor but which may not be present on any one systems
where Scrip 176 is enabled, you can use a single list including all
MS Windows services for all systems, regardless of whether any one
specific service is enabled on all systems. This makes the
configuration of Scrip 176 significantly faster, simpler, and easier.</P>
<P>To configure Scrip 176 please perform the following steps:</P>
<P>1) Log onto the ASI server (<A HREF="https://asiserverurl/main">https://asiservername/main</A>
)</P>
<P>2) At the upper right-hand corner of any page on the ASI server,
click on the <I>configuration</I> link in the <I>sites</I> navigation
bar (<A HREF="https://asiserverurl/main/config/index.php?act=site">https://asiservername/main/config/index.php?act=site</A>

<P>3) Click on the <I>view machines</I> link for a site where you
want to activate MS Windows services monitoring</P>
<P>4) Click on the <I>configure Scrips</I> link for any system at the
site where you want to activate MS Windows services monitoring.</P>
<P>5) Scroll down to the entry for Scrip 176 (<I>Services Restart</I>),
and click on the Scrip name 
</P>
<P>7) Click in the <I>Scrip enabled</I> box. Please note that you
need ensure that the <I>Group</I> setting for the <I>Scrip enabled</I>
configuration parameter is set to the site.</P>
<P>8) Click in the <I>Report (rather than restart) stopped service(s)</I>
box. Please note that if you want Scrip 176 to attempt to re-start MS
Windows services that stop running, you should leave the <I>Report
(rather than restart) stopped service(s)</I> box unchecked.</P>
<P>9) In the <I>Services to be monitored</I> configuration parameter,
enter the display name of each MS Windows service you want Scrip 176
to monitor. Each name has to be on a separate line. You can use any
text editor to create the list, then copy it, and paste it into the
<I>Services to be monitored</I> configuration parameter.</P>
<P>10) Adjust the Scrip 176 execution schedule to match your need for
service monitoring frequency. For example, if you want MS Windows
services to be checked every 5 minutes, you would change the Scrip
176 execution schedule as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent">In the Schedule parameter, change the
value of the <I>Minute</I> field from the default value of <B>10</B>
to:</P>

<P>If you use Scrip 231 (<I>Client Heartbeat</I>) instead of, or in
conjunction with Scrip 88 to monitor the availability of devices at
your sites, once you have configured Scrip 231 as you want, you
should enable the <I>ASI client not reporting</I> notification
following the same instructions as for the <I>Device status</I>
notification in the <I>Device status notification configuration</I>
sub-section of this section. This notification is triggered by the
non-occurrence of the Scrip 231 event. In other words, if Scrip 231
on a system covered by the notification does not post an event log,
the notification will be triggered. By default, the <I>ASI client not
reporting</I> notification is scheduled to run twice per hour. 
</P>
<P>In order to use the <I>ASI client not reporting</I> notification
effectively and minimize the likelihood of &ldquo;false positive
notifications&rdquo;: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>You should include all the systems that you want the
	notification cover using the <I>Include</I> parameter in the
	notification configuration page. Alternatively, you can use the
	<I>Exclude</I> parameter to exclude the systems you don't want the
	notification to cover.</P>
	<LI><P>Scrip 231 should be enabled globally on all systems at all
	sites (it is by default). There is no downside to doing that, and it
	minimizes false positives if, when you configure the notification,
	you include a system by mistake, or forget to exclude a system that
	you do not want covered by the notification.</P>
	<LI><P>On the systems you want covered by the <I>ASI client not
	reporting</I> notification, the Scrip 231 execution cycle (the
	Scrip's execution schedule) should be <B>shorter</B> than the
	execution cycle of the <I>ASI client not reporting</I> notification
	(i.e. Scrip 231 should run <B>MORE</B> frequently than the
	notification). This minimizes the probability of false positives.</P>

<H5>Web application not reporting notification configuration</H5>
<P>After you configure Scrip 100 to monitor a Web application, you
will want to set up a notification to alert you when the Web
application being monitored is not available.</P>
<P>First, you need to define an event filter to retrieve the Scrip
100 events reporting that the Web application being monitored is not
available, then you can set up a notification that uses that event
filter.</P>
<H6><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Event filter definition</FONT></H6>

<P>4) Type the name of the filter (e.g. Web application not
available) in the <I>Name</I> box</P>
<P>5) In the <I>Query filter</I> box enter the SQL clause for
selecting the Scrip 100 events reporting that the Web application you
configured the Scrip to monitor is not available. For example, we use
the following SQL clause we use to retrieve event logs reporting that
ASI server applications are not available:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in"><B>((scrip=100) AND (text3 LIKE
'%Cannot access MySQL database.%')) OR ((scrip=88) AND (text2 NOT

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">The relevant SQL clause for retrieving
Scrip 100 events reporting that the Web application you configured
the Scrip to monitor is not available, is <B>((scrip=100) AND (text3

<H5>MS Windows services monitoring notification configuration</H5>
<P>Scrip 176 posts event logs only when an MS Windows service it is
configured to monitor is not running. This minimizes the volume of
Scrip 176 event logs posted on the ASI server, and makes the task of
configuring related event notifications easier. 
</P>
<P>Event filters and notifications for the most popular MS Windows
services have been pre-defined on your ASI server. If the MS Windows
services you want to monitor are among those covered by existing
event filters and notifications, all you need to do is enable the
corresponding event notification.</P>
<P>To find out for which MS Windows services we have already defined
event filters and notifications, perform the following searches:</P>
<P>In the Event Filters page
(<A HREF="https://asiserverurl/main/event/search.php">https://asiservername/main/event/search.php</A>
):</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Type <B>scrip = 176</B> in the <I>Filter Contains</I>
	parameter in the Search Options panel</P>
	<LI><P>Click on the <I>Search</I> button</P>
</OL>
<P>In the Event Notifications page

</OL>
<P>If an MS Windows service you configured Scrip 176 to monitor is
not covered by any existing event filter and notification, then you
can use an existing event filter as the template for the event filter
for the service by using the copy function, and replacing the
keywords used in the event filter you are copying with those matching
the MS Windows services you want the new event filter to cover. Once
you have defined the new event filter, you can define the
corresponding event notification by copying an existing MS Windows
service monitoring notification, change its name and the event filter
it uses. 
</P>
<P>For example, after configuring Scrip 176 to monitor the <I>Windows
Management Instrumentation</I> MS Windows service, you would need to
define an event filter and notification for the service because it is
not covered by any existing event filter and notification. To do
this, you would:</P>
