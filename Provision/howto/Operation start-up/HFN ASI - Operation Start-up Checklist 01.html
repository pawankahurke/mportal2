<P>This document lists the tasks which you should perform to lay the
foundation for optimal use of Automated Support Infrastructure (ASI)
functions. 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Identify servers and non-server systems at each site, and
	place them in non-server and server groups. If so desired, place
	them also in site specific server and non-server groups.
	(<A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20operation%20start-up%20-%20how%20to%20Identify%20and%20group%20server%20systems%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">Identifying
	and Grouping Server Systems</A>)</P>
	<LI><P>Using the Scrip execution frequency wizard, configure Scrip
	177 (Scrip Configuration Changes) to run every three minutes on 1-3
	systems per sub-net at each new site including the servers
	identified in 1. (<A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20operation%20start-up%20-%20how%20to%20configure%20Scrip%20execution%20frequency%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">Configuring
	Scrip Execution Frequency</A>)</P>
	<LI><P>Pre-configure the ASI on-demand remote control function
	(Scrip 236) on all systems at each new site. On as needed basis,
	using the ASI on-demand remote control function, install the remote
	control utility (UltraVNC). (<A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20operation%20start-up%20-%20how%20to%20Pre-configure%20the%20ASI%20on-demand%20remote%20control%20function%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">Pre-configuring

	function (Scrip 227) on all systems to run daily, and prevent a
	known problem where the disk defragmentation utility hangs.

	gateway availability, and enable the corresponding e-mail
	notification. (<A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20operation%20start-up%20-%20how%20to%20Configure%20Internet%20gateway%20monitoring%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">Configuring

	<LI><P>Identify the systems at each new site where Symantec Backup
	Exec, and Microsoft NT Backup are installed. Please note that this
	same procedure, with the appropriate configuration changes, can be
	used to identify whether any application is installed on systems at
	the new site. (<A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20operation%20start-up%20-%20How%20to%20find%20out%20on%20which%20systems%20a%20back-up%20application%20is%20installed%20and%20active%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">Finding

	client default on all systems. (<A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20operation%20start-up%20-%20how%20to%20Verify%20the%20configuration%20for%20Scrip%20237%20(Microsoft%20Update%20Management)%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">Verifying
