<H3>Configuring Device Availability Monitoring</H3>
<P>Scrip 88 (Network Devices and Services Availability) can be used
to monitor the availability of servers at a site. In the simplest
case, the ASI client is configured on one machine which tests the
availability of other devices. It is not required that the devices
whose availability is to be tested run the ASI client. The only
requirement is that they can be reached from the system where the ASI
client runs (by NetBIOS name, URL, or by IP address), and will
respond to ping or to a TCP packet. Device availability monitoring
can be made more robust by implementing a redundancy scheme. For
example, suppose the ASI client is running on Machine1, Machine2 and
Machine3. Machine1 could test Machine2 and Machine3; Machine2 could
test Machine1 and Machine3; and Machine3 would be set up to test
Machine1 and Machine2. Each of these machines could also test the
availability of other machines, whether or not those machines are
running the ASI client. 
</P>
<P>In general, you should have at least two, but no more than three
devices to monitor the availability of an IP device or IP service. 
</P>
<P>Typically, you will be able to use ping (ICMP) to test the
availability of devices inside a private network. If necessary, it is
also possible to monitor a device by testing its response to a TCP
packet on a particular port. 
</P>
<P>Whenever possible, you should avoid using IP addresses to identify
devices to be tested devices that test the availability of other
devices (testers). This is for two main reasons: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Most environments are configured to use DHCP. If you used IP
	addresses to identify tester devices or devices to be tested, you
	will need to update the configuration of Scrip 88 whenever IP
	addresses change. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Identifying devices to be tested and tester devices by their
	URL or NetBIOS name makes them more easily recognizable.

<P>If you plan on using one machine to do all the device availability
monitoring, you have completed the Scrip configuration phase of the
activity, and  should proceed to the next section on configuring the
&ldquo;device status&rdquo; event notification. 
</P>
<P>However, for greater reliability of the device monitoring process
(nothing to do with ASI software reliability), we advise that you
configure device availability monitoring on an additional machine
performing steps 1. to 9. above for this other machine.</P>
<P>If the site where you want to monitor device availability has two
or more systems whose availability you want to monitor, and the ASI
client is installed on these systems, you can use Scrip 88 on each of
these systems to configure a highly reliable redundant round-robin
device availability monitoring scheme where Scrip 88 on the systems
whose availability you want to monitor is used to monitor the other
systems. For example, suppose you have a site with three servers,
server1, server2, and server3, whose availability you want to
monitor, and on which the ASI client is installed. In this case the
entries for the Scrip 88 &ldquo;Machines to be tested&rdquo;
configuration parameter would be:</P>
<P>Machines to be tested by server1: 
</P>
<PRE>1,server2,ICMP,0,4,1000
1,server3,ICMP,0,4,1000</PRE><P>
Machines to be tested by server2: 
</P>
<PRE>1,server1,ICMP,0,4,1000
1,server3,ICMP,0,4,1000</PRE><P>
Machines to be tested by server3: 
</P>
<PRE>1,server1,ICMP,0,4,1000
1,server2,ICMP,0,4,1000</PRE><P>
If you had a site with two servers whose device availability you want
to monitor, and the ASI client were installed on both systems, you
could configure Scrip 88 on each server to monitor the other server,
and then select another system at the site where you could configure
Scrip 88 to monitor the availability of both servers.</P>
<P>At sites where you have more than three servers, assuming that the
ASI client is installed on all servers, you can select two servers
where you would configure Scrip 88 to monitor the availability of all
other servers, and then configure Scrip 88 on two of the other
servers to monitor the two servers where Scrip 88 is configured to
monitor the availability of all servers.</P>
<H4>Configuring the &ldquo;device status&rdquo; event notification 
</H4>
<P>When you have finished configuring Scrip 88, you will need to set
up the corresponding event notification on the ASI Server. To start
with, you can use the pre-defined global event notification called
<I>device status</I>.
