<H3>ASI Registry Management</H3>
<H4>Quick Start</H4>
<P>By following the instructions in this section, you can quickly,
and easily retrieve portions of the system registry you are
insterested in from one or more systems, and then add or change
registry keys as you wish.</P>
<P>The ASI registry management user interface is modeled after the
familiar Microsoft regedit user interface. you navigate the portions
of the registry retrieved from a system via the left pane. You access
and change specific registry key value names and data via the right
pane.</P>
<H5>Accessing the registry management function on your ASI server</H5>
<P>i) Log onto the ASI server (https://asiservername/main).</P>
<P>ii) Click on the &quot;Use extended interface&quot; link on the
right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and
date.</P>
<P>iii) At the upper right-hand corner of any extended ASI server
interface page, click on the &quot;wizard&quot; link in the &quot;sites&quot;
navigation bar. The &quot;Configuration Wizard&quot; page will be
displayed.</P>
<P>iv) Click on the &quot;Registry management&quot; wizard entry. The
&quot;ASI Site and System Registry Management&quot; dashboard will be
displayed.</P>
<H5>Retrieving and changing system registry entries</H5>
<P>1) Scroll to the bottom of the the left pane of the ASI registry
management control panel
(https://asiservername/main/regmgmt/rmgt.php), and click on the &quot;Base
Keys&quot; entry. The &quot;Base keys&quot; page will be displayed in
the right pane.</P>
<P>2) Click on the &quot;new&quot; link in the right pane. A form for
the entry of a new base key definition will be displayed.</P>
<P>3) Enter a base key name in the &quot;Base Key Name&quot; field.</P>
<P>4) Select a root key value from the &quot;Root Key&quot; pull-down
list.</P>
<P>5) Enter the path to the portion of the registry you want to
retrieve when using the base key you are defining in the &quot;Subkey&quot;
field. Here are some examples of &quot;Subkey&quot; filed entries:</P>
<P>- Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings</P>
<P>- Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer</P>
<P>Please note that &quot;Subkey&quot; filed entries do not start
with a &quot;\&quot;.</P>
<P>6) If you want the base key you are defining to be available to
all users of your ASI server, check the &quot;Global&quot;
configuration parameter box.</P>
<P>7) Click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. The settings of the newly
defined base key will be displayed.</P>
<P>8) After reviewing the settings of the newly defined base key, and
ensuring that they are as you want them to be, click on the &quot;Finish&quot;
button. The &quot;update successful&quot; message will be displayed.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>After defining a base key, you need to define a filter to use for
retrieval of the portion of the registry you are interested in. The
filter you will create will be based on the base key you just
defined.</P>
<P>9) In the left pane of the ASI registry management control panel,
immediately above the &quot;Base Keys&quot; entry, click on the
&quot;Filters&quot; entry. The &quot;Filters&quot; page will be
displayed in the right pane.</P>
<P>10) Click on the &quot;new&quot; link in the right pane. A form
for the entry of a new filter definition will be displayed.</P>
<P>11) Enter a filter name in the &quot;Filter Name&quot; field.</P>
<P>12) Select a base key value from the &quot;Base Key&quot;
pull-down list.</P>
<P>13) If you want the base key you are defining to be available to
all users of your ASI server, check the &quot;Global&quot;
configuration parameter box. Please note that if you want the filter
you are defining to be &quot;global&quot; The base key it uses needs
to be &quot;global&quot; too.</P>
<P>14) Leave the &quot;Recursive&quot; configuration parameter box
checked.</P>
<P>15) Click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. The settings of the
newly defined filter will be displayed.</P>
<P>16) After reviewing the settings of the newly defined filter, and
ensuring that they are as you want them to be, click on the &quot;Finish&quot;
button. The &quot;update successful&quot; message will be displayed.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>After defining the filter, you are ready to define an action for
the retrieval of the portion of the registry you are interested in.
The action you will create will use the filter you just defined.</P>
<P>The following steps can be used to define registry retrieval
action for either a single system, a group of systems, or a site,
depending on the left-pane entry (system, site, or user defined
group) you click on. As an example we will use a site.</P>
<P>17) In the left pane of the ASI registry management control panel,
click on the entry for the site where you want to retrieve the
portion of the registry using the filter defined in steps 9)-16)
above. The &quot;Site &lt;site name&gt;&quot; page will be displayed
in the right pane.</P>
<P>18) Click on the &quot;list&quot; link in the right pane. A form
for the entry of a new action definition will be displayed.</P>
<P>19) Enter an action name in the &quot;Action Name&quot; field.</P>
<P>20) Select a filter from the &quot;Filter Name&quot; pull-down
list.</P>
<P>21) Adjust the value of the &quot;Limit returned&quot;
configuration parameter depending on the expected number of registry
items retrieved using the filter you selected. Please be very careful
about making the &quot;Limit returned&quot; configuration parameter
too large. If you are not confident about the expected number of
registry items retrieved using the filter you selected, you should
start by giving the &ldquo;Limit returned&rdquo; configuration
parameter to a relatively low value (e.g. 1000), and then repeat the
retrieval operation increasing the value of the &ldquo;Limit
returned&rdquo; configuration parameter, if necessary.</P>
<P>22) Check the &quot;Clear all old data&quot; configuration
parameter box.</P>
<P>23) Click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. The settings of the
newly defined action will be displayed.</P>
<P>24) After reviewing the settings of the newly defined action, and
ensuring that they are as you want them to be, click on the &quot;Finish&quot;
button. The &quot;update successful&quot; message will be displayed.</P>
<P>The next time Scrip 160 (Registry Management) runs, on the system,
site, or group you ran the &quot;list&quot; action on, it will
execute the action. Scrip 160 runs as defined by its schedule (by
default Scrip 160 runs at 2 AM, once per hour on the hour between 6
AM and 6 PM, and at 9 PM, on weekdays), or on-demand when you click
on the &quot;Run Registry Managment now&quot; Execute button. Please
keep in mind that the command to run Scrip 160 will be retrieved by
the system, site, or group you ran the registry retrieval action on
according to the Scrip 177 (Scrip Configuration Update) schedule on
the systems you ran the registry retrieval action on.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Next, we will list the steps you should follow to change a
registry key value, or add a registry key to one system, a site, or a
group of systems.</P>
<P>The following steps can be used to change the value of a registry
key on a single system.</P>
<P>25) In the left pane of the ASI registry management control panel,
if not already expanded, expand the entry for the system where you
want to change a regsitry key value until the registry key value name
whose value data you want to change is displayed in the right pane.</P>
<P>26) Click on the &quot;Action&quot; box for each registry key
value name whose value data you want to change in the right pane,
then click on the &quot;Set&quot; button. A page with the registry
key value names whose value data you want to change will be displayed
in the right pane.</P>
<P>27) Enter the new registry key value data. 
</P>
<P>28) Click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. A page with the changed
registry key value data will be displayed.</P>
<P>29) After reviewing the changed registry key value data, and
ensuring that they are as you want them to be, click on the &quot;Finish&quot;
button. The &quot;update successful&quot; message will be displayed.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<HR>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If you want to change the value of a registry key for an entire
site, you will need to know the complete path for the registry key
value names you want to change, and then follow these steps:</P>
<P>a) Click on the site name in the left pane</P>
<P>b) Click on &quot;Set&quot; in the right pane</P>
<P>c) Enter a name for the registry keey value change in the &quot;Action
Name&quot; field</P>
<P>d) In the &quot;Subkey&quot; filed, enter the complete path for
the registry key value name whose value you want to change, including
the registry key name 
</P>
<P>e) In the &quot;Value Name&quot; field, enter the registry key
value name whose value you want to change f) From &quot;Value Type&quot;
pull-down list, select the value type for the registry key value name</P>
<P>h) In the &quot;Value Data&quot; field, enter the new value for
the registry key value name whose value you want to change</P>
<P>i) click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. A page with the registry
key, the value name, and value data you entered will be displayed.</P>
<P>j) After reviewing the changed registry key value data, and
ensuring that they are as you want them to be, click on the &quot;Finish&quot;
button. The &quot;update successful&quot; message will be displayed.</P>
<H4>Retrieving registry information</H4>
<P>The ASI registry management function lets you retrieve any portion
of the registry from one, some, or all systems. If you wanted to you
could use it to retrieve a system's entire registry. However, we
strongly advise you to think twice before doing that because of the
size of the registry.</P>
<P>The ASI registry management user interface is modeled after the
familiar Microsoft regedit user interface. you navigate the portions
of the registry retrieved from a system via the left pane. You access
and change specific registry key value names and data via the right
pane.</P>
<P>In general, the registry retrieval process works as follows:</P>
<P>1) You define registry branches, or keys you want to retrieve (we
call these definitions Base Keys)</P>
<P>2) You define filters using Basekeys to further specify registry
key values you want to retrieve</P>
<P>3) You execute actions consisting of a filter, the maximum number
of records you want to retrieve (this is very important protection
against indavertent mistakes in Basekey and filter definition), and
the system(s) the filter applies to.</P>
<H5>Definitions</H5>
<P><U>Basekey</U></P>
<P>BaseKey is an ASI term. Basekeys contain of any portion of a
registry key, except for key value names and key value data. Basekey
entries consist of a root key (see definition below), and a sub Key.
A sub key is the path for the portion of the registry branch a
Basekey is used to retrieve. it determines the scope of a Basekey. 
</P>
<P><U>Root key</U></P>
<P>The Microsoft Windows registry is sub-divided into six sections
called root keys.</P>
<P><U>Registry key branch</U></P>
<P>A registry key is the partial path for a registry entry starting
from a root key, as displayed in the Microsoft regedit left pane.</P>
<P><U>Registry key name</U></P>
<P>This is the complete path for a registry entry as displayed in the
left pane of Microsoft regedit. This is also referred to as a
&quot;registry key&quot;</P>
<P><U>Registry key value name</U></P>
<P>This is the label of the value for a registry key found in the
right pane of Microsoft regedit.</P>
<P><U>Registry key value data</U></P>
<P>This is the value assigned to a registry key value name displayed
in the right pane of Microsoft regedit.</P>
<H5>Basekeys</H5>
<P>Basekey entries consist of the following components:</P>
<P><U>Base Key Name</U></P>
<P>This is the name of the base key entry</P>
<P><U>RootKey</U></P>
<P>A root key selected from a pull-down list containing the following
values:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_USERS</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_PERFORMANCE_TEXT</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_PERFORMANCE_NLSTEXT</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG</P>
	<LI><P>HKEY_DYN_DATA</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note that you can skip this field, and enter the root key
as part of the &quot;Subkey&quot; entry. 
</P>
<P><U>SubKey</U></P>
<P>Here you enter the registry branch path including the root key, if
not selected in the &quot;Rootkey&quot; field, covered by the base
key you are defining. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Please note:</P>
<P>a) The &quot;Subkey&quot; entry can consist of a complete registry
key path (excluding key value name and key value data). However, in
general, this would not be advisable, as Basekeys are meant to be
used to retrieve registry branches, while filters should be used for
the retrieval of specific registry keys (also called registry key
names)</P>
<P>b) &quot;Subkey&quot; entries cannot start with a \</P>
<P><U>Global</U></P>
<P>Enabling the &quot;Global&quot; configuration option gives all
users access to the basekey being defined. This configuration option
is only available to administrative users, and can only be changed by
the user that created the baseky entry.</P>
<H5>Filters</H5>
<P>You use filters to retrieve portions of the registry you are
interested in reviewing for potential further action. Filtering
actions can use one or more of the following:</P>
<P>1) Key name</P>
<P>2) Key value name</P>
<P>3) Key value type</P>
<P>4) Key value data</P>
<P>Your decision to use one or more of the above filtering elements
is governed by the &quot;Enable&quot; check box associated with each
of them.</P>
<P>Filters consist of the following components, all of which are
under your complete control:</P>
<P><U>Filter Name</U></P>
<P>This is the name you want to use for the filter.</P>
<P><U>Base Key Name</U></P>
<P>This is base key used for the retrieval action. It is selected via
a pull-down from a list of Base keys you previously defined.</P>
<P><U>Key</U></P>
<P>This is the portion the path for the specific registry key you
want to use the filter to retrieve. This entry is necessary if you
want to retrieve a specific registry key, and the Basekey used
defines a registry branch, not a complete registry key path. 
</P>
<P>The entire key name is therefore composed of the root key (from
the Basekey), followed by the sub key (from the Basekey), followed by
the key entered in this field. The key entry must start with a
backslash (&quot;\&quot;). 
</P>
<P><U>Key Wild</U></P>
<P>When &quot;Key Wild&quot; is enabled, this indicates that the key
name is treated as a wil dcard. Standard MS-DOS wild card characters
are supported. A question mark (&quot;?&quot;) matches a single
character, and an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) matches any number of
characters. 
</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Base key =
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Key = U*</P>
<P>Both of the following keys would be retrieved when using the
filter with the above key setting:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\URL</P>
<P>and</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall</P>
<P><U>Value Name</U></P>
<P>When you enter a value in the &quot;Value Name&quot; field, the
filter will retrieve registry keys based on their matching the entry
in the &quot;Value Name&quot; field.</P>
<P><U>Value Name Wild</U></P>
<P>If the &quot;Value Name Wild&quot; is enabled, the entry in the
&quot;Value Name&quot; field is treated as a wild card. Standard
MS-DOS wild card characters are supported. A question mark (&quot;?&quot;)
matches a single character, and an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) matches
any number of characters. 
</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Base key =
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
Settings\Zones\2</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Key = &lt;no entry&gt;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Value Name = 1a*</P>
<P>A filter with the above settings would let you retrieve all
cookie, privacy and authentication related advanced settings for the
&quot;Trusted Sites&quot; zone</P>
<P><U>Value Type</U></P>
<P>Here, you select from a pull-down list the type for the registry
key value data entered in the &quot;Value Data&quot; field (see
immediately below). The filter will retrieve only those registry keys
whose value data type matches the one selected with this
configuration parameter.</P>
<P><U>Value Data</U></P>
<P>When you enter a value in the &quot;Value Data&quot; field, the
filter will retrieve registry keys based on their matching the entry
in the &quot;Value Data&quot; field.</P>
<P><U>Value Data Wild</U></P>
<P>If the &quot;Value Data Wild&quot; is enabled, the entry in the
&quot;Value Data&quot; field is treated as a wild card. Standard
MS-DOS wild card characters are supported. A question mark (&quot;?&quot;)
matches a single character, and an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) matches
any number of characters. 
</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Base key =
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Key = &lt;no entry&gt;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Value Name = Start Page</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Value Type = REG_SZ</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">Value Data = *cnn*</P>
<P>A filter with the above settings would let you retrieve all MS IE
start page registry keys where the start page is set to a CNN site.</P>
<P><U>Global</U></P>
<P>Enabling the &quot;Global&quot; configuration option gives all
users access to the filter being defined. This configuration option
is only available to administrative users, and can only be changed by
the user that created the filter entry.</P>
<P><U>Recursive</U></P>
<P>This configuration parameter is enabled by default. It indicates
that the filter applies to all keys under the selected keys as well
as the selected keys themselves. 
</P>
<H4>ASI Registry Management Actions</H4>
<P>With ASI registry management you can take one of three actions:</P>
<P>- Retrieve all (we advise against doing this), or a portion of the
system registry from one or more systems at your sites. We call this
action &quot;list&quot;</P>
<P>- Add one or more registry keys to one or more systems at your
sites. We call this action &quot;set&quot;</P>
<P>- Change the value of one or more existing registry keys retrieved
using a &quot;list&quot; action</P>
<P>There is no practical limit to the number or mix of actions you
take on any one or group of systems.</P>
<H5>List Actions</H5>
<P>You can initiate &quot;List&quot; actions from one of the
following points:</P>
<P>1) Clicking on a filter name. A right-pane page titled &quot;Filter
&lt;filter name&gt;&quot; listing the following actions will be
displayed:</P>
<P>- <I>list</I> - List keys using this filter 
</P>
<P>- <I>delete</I> - Delete this filter 
</P>
<P>- <I>edit</I> - Edit this filter</P>
<P>Clicking on the &quot;list&quot; link, will generate the &quot;Select
the specifications for this action:&quot; right-pane page.</P>
<P>2) Clicking on a system name. A right-pane page titled &quot;Machine
&lt;machine name&gt;&quot; listing the following actions will be
displayed:</P>
<P>- <I>set</I> - Set a registry value on a single machine 
</P>
<P>- <I>list</I> - List keys on this machine 
</P>
<P>- <I>delete</I> - Delete registry data for this machine 
</P>
<P>- <I>actions</I> - List actions for this machine 
</P>
<P>Clicking on the &quot;list&quot; link, will generate the &quot;Select
the specifications for this action:&quot; right-pane page. This page
differs from the one reached by clicking on the &quot;list&quot; link
in a filter right-panel page in the fact that it does not have a
machine/site selection parameter.</P>
<P>3) Clicking on a site name. A right-pane page titled &quot;Site
&lt;machine name&gt;&quot; listing the following actions will be
displayed:</P>
<P>- <I>set</I> - Set a registry value on all machines at the site</P>
<P>- <I>list</I> - List keys on all machines at the site 
</P>
<P>- <I>delete</I> - Delete registry data for all machines at the
site 
</P>
<P>- <I>actions</I> - List actions at site 
</P>
<P>Clicking on the &quot;list&quot; link, will generate the &quot;Select
the specifications for this action:&quot; right-pane page. This page
differs from the one reached by clicking on the &quot;list&quot; link
in a filter right-panel page in the fact that it does not have a
machine/site selection parameter.</P>
<P>Please refer to the &quot;Quick Start&quot; section of this
document for step-by-step instructions for using the ASI registry
management &quot;list&quot; function.</P>
<H5>Change Actions</H5>
<P>With the ASI registry management function, you can change the
value of one or more registry keys on one system with a single
action. You can change the values of registry keys using the &quot;change&quot;
function only after you have first retrieved them using the ASI
registry management &quot;list&quot; function. 
</P>
<P>If you want to change registry key values without first retrieving
them, or if you want to change registry key values on all systems at
a site, you should use the ASI registry management &quot;set&quot;
function. 
</P>
<P>As mentioned earlier, the ASI registry management user interface
is modeled after the familiar Microsoft regedit user interface. you
navigate the portions of the registry retrieved from a system via the
left pane. You access and change specific registry key value names
and data via the right pane.</P>
<P>First you need to reach the registry key value names and data you
want to change, as you would when using Microsoft regedit you
&quot;expand&quot; the registry tree for the system where you want to
change one or more registry keys by clicking on the &quot;+&quot;
icons in the left pane until the registry key value names and data
you want to change are displayed in the right pane.</P>
<P>Once they are, you will be able to select the registry key value
names whose value you want to change via selection check boxes. Once
you do that, just as with Microsoft regedit, the ASI registry
management right panel will display a registry key value name edit
box. Unlike Microsoft regedit, with ASI registry management, you are
able to change the value of multiple registry key value names with a
single edit action.</P>
<P>Please refer to the &quot;Quick Start&quot; section of this
document for step-by-step instructions for using the ASI registry
management &quot;change&quot; function.</P>
<H5>Set Actions</H5>
<P>With the &quot;set&quot; function, you can add registry keys, or
change them without having to first retrieve them. In order to use
this powerful function, you need to know the complete path for the
registry key value names you want to change and their value data
types.</P>
<P>You can access the ASI registry management &quot;set&quot;
function by:</P>
<P>i) Clicking on a system name. A right-pane page titled &quot;Machine
&lt;machine name&gt;&quot; listing the following actions will be 
</P>
<P>displayed:</P>
<P>- <I>set</I> - Set a registry value on a single machine 
</P>
<P>- <I>list</I> - List keys on this machine 
</P>
<P>- <I>delete</I> - Delete registry data for this machine 
</P>
<P>- <I>actions</I> - List actions for this machine 
</P>
<P>Clicking on the &quot;set&quot; link, will generate the &quot;Set
registry value on machine &lt;machine name&gt;&quot; right-pane page.
</P>
<P>ii) Clicking on a site name. A right-pane page titled &quot;Site
&lt;machine name&gt;&quot; listing the following actions will be
displayed:</P>
<P>- <I>set</I> - Set a registry value on all machines at the site</P>
<P>- <I>list</I> - List keys on all machines at the site 
</P>
<P>- <I>delete</I> - Delete registry data for all machines at the
site 
</P>
<P>- <I>actions</I> - List actions at site 
</P>
<P>Clicking on the &quot;set&quot; link, will generate the &quot;Set
registry value at site &lt;site name&gt;&quot; right-pane page.</P>
<P>In both cases, you will be asked to give the &quot;set&quot;
action a name, and then enter the complete registry key path, up to
and including registry key value name, registry key value data and
type, exactly as you want them to be.</P>
<P>Please refer to the &quot;Quick Start&quot; section of this
document for step-by-step instructions for using the ASI registry
management &quot;set&quot; function.</P>
