This is the site specific email address that is used by the ASI clients at a site when they need to directly send email to the ASI server. This is currently only used when email logging is enabled on the ASI client. By default it is not.

- Proxy URL – If no proxy server is used at the site, leave this entry blank. If a proxy server is used at the site, please:
i) CONTACT HANDSFREE NETWORKS ii) Enter the site-specific address of the proxy server and the port it uses. If the proxy server at the site requires authentication, you should add a working user id and password to the proxy URL. The syntax of an entry in Proxy URL is:
http://<user name>:<user password>@<proxy server name>:<proxy port> 
Please remember that ASI requires that ports 80, 443, and 37 (time server) be left open for outbound communication.

From this pull-down list you select the site specific Scrip configuration for the ASI client at the site, after installation is completed. The list includes all Scrip configurations defined for the user currently logged in, plus the two special options "All" and "None". The “All” configuration option enables all Scrips. The “None” configuration option puts the ASI client in dormant state for an indefinite period of time. In this state, the Scrips listed in the Base Scrip configuration list section of this document are activated and enabled.

They are sufficient to let you activate the ASI client at a time of your choosing. Selecting “Uninstall” will result in removal of the ASI client from all systems where it was installed for the start-up phase.
