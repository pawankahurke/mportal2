How to produce a report or notification covering one or more sites
<A HREF="#top"><FONT FACE="Wingdings"><FONT SIZE=1>&aacute;</FONT></FONT><FONT SIZE=1>top
</FONT></A>
</H4>
<P>1) Set up a <A HREF="HFN%20ASI%20user%20management%20how-to%2001.html" TARGET="_blank">new
user</A> (via the admin module) with access only to the site(s) you
want the new user to be able to access (with &quot;Normal&quot;
privileges, and no additional rights). 
</P>
<P>a) Log onto your ASI server (https://asiservername/main)</P>
<P>b) Click on the &quot;Use extended interface&quot; link on the
right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and
date.</P>
<P>c) In the &quot;tools&quot; navigation bar, click on the &quot;admin&quot;
link.</P>
<P>d) Click on the &quot;new user&quot; link located above the table
listing users defined on the ASI server.</P>
<P>e) Fill in &quot;name&quot; (eg. acme), &quot;password&quot;, and
&quot;confirm&quot; fields.</P>
<P>f) In the &quot;Notify mail&quot;, and &quot;Report mail&quot;
fields enter the e-mail address of the notification and report
recipient(s). 
</P>
<P>g) In the &quot;Sites&quot; list, click on the entry for the site
you want the new user to have access to. If you want to select more
than one site, press the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key and click the mouse on
the entry for each site you want the new user to have access to.</P>
<P>h) Click on the &quot;Create&quot; button at the bottom of the
page.</P>
<P>After you have created a user following the above steps, all
enabled global reports (both event and asset), and global event
notifications, when executed as per their schedule, will run for each
user covering only the sites accessible to that user.</P>
<P>2) You can also produce a report (asset or event), and event
notification covering one or more sites by configuring a report (or
notification) to cover only selected sites. The following steps
describe this procedure for an event report. The steps for defining
an asset report, or event notification covering one or more sites are
the same except for the fact that you would perform them on the
&quot;Asset Reports&quot;, and &quot;Event Notifications&quot; pages
respectively.</P>
<P>a) Log onto your ASI server (https://asiservername/main)</P>
<P>b) Click on the &quot;Use extended interface&quot; link on the
right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and
date.</P>
<P>c) In the &quot;events&quot; navigation bar, click on the
&quot;reports&quot; link
(https://asiservername/main/event/report.php).</P>
<P>d) Retrieve the report you want to configure to cover one or more
site:</P>
<P>In the &quot;Name Contains&quot; field in the &quot;Search
Options&quot; panel enter one or more words from the report title,
and click on the &quot;Search&quot; button.</P>
<P>e) Scroll down to the entry for the report you want to configure
to cover one or more site, and click on the &quot;copy&quot; link to
the left of the report entry. 
</P>
<P>f) Change the report title entered in the &quot;Report title&quot;
field, as desired.</P>
<P>g) In the &quot;Include&quot; list, click on the entry for the
site you want the report to cover. If you want to select more than
one site, press the &quot;Ctrl&quot; key and click the mouse on the
entry for each site you want the report to cover.</P>
<P>h) Click on the &quot;Add&quot; button at the bottom of the page.</P>
<P>Note that once the new report has been added, it will run either
at its scheduled time, or on-demand when you click on the &ldquo;run&rdquo;
link to the left of the report name in its entry on the &ldquo;Event
Reports&rdquo; page. In the case of an asset report, you would do the
same on the &ldquo;Asset Reports&rdquo; page.</P>
<P>Please also note that if you decided to change the schedule of the
new report to type &ldquo;Immediate&rdquo; (and selected a period for
the report to cover), once the report (event or asset) runs, it will
be automatically deleted.</P>
