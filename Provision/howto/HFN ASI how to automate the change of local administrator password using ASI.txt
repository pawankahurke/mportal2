In this "how-to" note, we will describe how using ASI you can automate the change of the local administrator password on all systems at a site.

The process consists of three main steps:

A) Deploy the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility on target systems using Scrip 100

B) Configure and run one of the program execution Scrips (89, 151-157, or 212-215) to perform the local administrator password change

C) Remove the cusrmgr.exe Microsoft utility from all target systems using one of Scrips (60, or 217-221)


How to deploy "cusrmgr.exe" on target systems
============================================

Scrip 100 is a powerful and highly configurable Scrip. Below, you will find instructions for getting to the Scrip 100 configuration page, and guiding you in the configuration Scrip to download "cusrmgr.exe" to a location of your choice. In this example, we selected the "temp" folder in the main Microsoft Windows directory. These instructions do not include detailed information about each Scrip 100 configuration parameter. Clicking on the help link on the second-level navigation bar (labeled configuration on the right side of the Scrip 100 configuration page) will open the Scrip 100 configuration help file in a new window on your desktop (https://asiservername/main/config/help/s00100.htm ).

1) Log onto the ASI server (https://asiservername/main ).

2) Click on the "Use extended interface" link on the right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and date.

3) At the upper right-hand corner of any page on the ASI server, click on the configuration link in the sites navigation bar (https://asiservername/main/config/index.php?act=site ).

4) Click on the view machines link for the site of the system you want to distribute file(s) to.

5) Click on the configure Scrips link for the system you want to distribute file(s) to. Please note that if you want to distribute files to all systems at a site, you can pick any system at the site.

6) Scroll down to the entry for Scrips 100 (File Distribution and Retrieval), and click on the Scrip name. The Scrip 100 configuration page will be displayed.

To change the local administrator password on all systems at a site, you can pick any system.

7) If you want to distribute one or more files once, do not enable the Scrip, otherwise click in the Scrip enabled box. If you want to distribute a file only to the system whose Scrip 100 configuration page you are viewing, select "machine <name>" from the Group pull-down list for the "Scrip enabled" configuration parameter. If you want to distribute one ore more files to all systems at the site, select "site <name>" from the Group pull-down list for the "Scrip enabled" configuration parameter.
 
8) If the file(s) you want to distribute reside on a networked resource with access control enabled, or needs to access a networked resource, click on the "Impersonation enabled" box (you can leave the Group setting for the "Impersonation enabled" configuration parameter set to "site <name>"). Please refer to the Scrip 100 configuration help file for detailed information and configuration instructions for enabling impersonation support (https://asiservername/main/config/help/s00100.htm ).

In tha case of the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility, enabling impersonation is not necessary.

9) Scroll down to the "File distribution. File location group definitions" configuration parameter where you specify the location where you want to distribute the file(s) to. 

In the case of the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility, copy and paste the following entries in a new line in the "File distribution. File location group definitions" configuration parameter:

wintemp,c:\windows\temp
winnttemp,c:\winnt\temp

The group selection parameter for the "File distribution. File location group definitions" configuration parameter should be set to "site <name>".

The wintemp location applies to systems running Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003, and Vista. The winnttemp location applies to systems running Microsoft Windows 2000.

10) Depending on the requirements of the file distribution operation, you can choose to enable the "File distribution. Overwrite existing file(s)" configuration parameter.

In the case of the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility, you should enable the "File distribution. Overwrite existing file(s)" configuration parameter. The group selection parameter for the "File distribution. Overwrite existing file(s)" configuration parameter should be set to "site <name>".

11) In the "File distribution and retrieval command line(s)" configuration parameter, enter the command line(s) Scrip 100 will use to distribute files for you. You can enter as many file distribution command lines as you like, enabling and disabling them as needed.

Please note that in the "File distribution and retrieval command line(s)" configuration parameter, you can enter both file retrieval and distribution command lines, in any order. Scrip 100 will automatically detect whether a command line is for retrieving or distributing a file based on the contents of the command line, e.g. whether the command line contains an e-mail group, or a file location group entry.

In order to distribute the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility to all systems at a site regardless of the operating system they run (Microsoft Windows, 2000, XP, Server 2003, or Vista), you should copy and paste the following two file distribution command lines in new lines in the "File distribution and retrieval command line(s)" configuration parameter:

1,http://handsfreenetworks.com/download/cusrmgr.exe,wintemp,,0
1,http://handsfreenetworks.com/download/cusrmgr.exe,winnttemp,,0

The group selection parameter for the "File distribution and retrieval command line(s)" configuration parameter should be set to "site <name>".

Scrip 100 will run both command lines. Depending on the operating system running on each system, one command line will run suuccessfully, and one will fail.

12) If the file distribution you want Scrip 100 to perform is a one-time operation, ignore the schedule parameter. Otherwise set the schedule as required. For example, if you want to retrieve a file every day at 7 AM, you would set the Minute field (the first field from the top) to 0, the Hour field (the second field) to 7, and the Weekday field (the fifth field) to *, skipping the Day and Month fields. In all likelihood, you would leave the "Random minute" field (the sixth field) to 0. You would probably also leave the "Type" field (the seventh field) set to 2, unless you wanted the file distribution operation to occur immediately when the system starts-up in case the system was shut down when the file distribution was scheduled to occur (at 7 AM every day). If you left the value of the "Fail limit" field (the eight field from the top) set to 0, and the Type field set to 2, Scrip 100 would post an event log reporting failure to run because the system was turned off, or the ASI client was not running, the first time such a failure occurs.

If you want the schedule of the file distribution operation to be the same on all systems at the site, select "site <name>" from the Group pull-down list for the schedule configuration parameter is on. Otherwise, leave it set to "machine <name>".

In the case of the distribution of the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility, you can skip the configuration of the Scrip 100 schedule parameter.

13) Click on the Distribute / Retrieve file(s) now "Execute" button. If you want to have Scrip 100 distribute the file(s) to all systems at a site select "site <name>" from the pull-down list to the right of the "Execute" button. if you want to run the file(s) only on the system whose Scrip 100 configuration page you are viewing, you should select "machine <name>" from the pull-down list to the right of the "Execute" button.

When distributing "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility, select "site <name>" from the pull-down list to the right of the "Execute" button.

14) If you configured Scrip 100 to perform a periodic file distribution operation, click on the "Submit Changes" button. The "Changes Recorded" page will be displayed.

15) Click on the "machines" link on the second-level navigation bar (the one labeled "configuration"). The "Configuration - <site name> Machines" page will be displayed.

16) The entry in the "Changed" column for the system you configured Scrip 100 on will show the date and time of the action you just took. Before being able to retrieve the Scrip 100 event log reporting completion of the file retrieval action, you will need to wait until the entry in the "Changed" column changes to "No" (Use the refresh function in your browser). This is dependent on the frequency of execution of Scrip 177 (Scrip Configuration Update). Please refer to the "How to change the frequency with which the ASI client retrieves Scrip configuration changes from the ASI server" section of the "System management, maintenance, and problem management actions" Web page for instructions on how to change the Scrip 177 execution schedule.

17) As soon as the entry in the "Changed" column for the system you configured Scrip 100 on changes to "No", click on the "ad-hoc" link in the "events" navigation bar found at the upper right-hand corner of any page on the ASI server (https://asiservername/main/event/event.php ). The "Ad-hoc Event Query Form" page will be displayed.

In the "Select Additional Search Criteria for Events" section of the "Ad-hoc Event Query Form" page:
20) From the "Site" pull-down list select the site of the system you retrieved the list of running processes from

21) If you ran Scrip 100 only on one system, from the "Machine" pull-down list select the system you ran Scrip 100 on. Otherwise, leave the "Machine" pull-down lists election set to "All".

In this case, leave the "Machine" pull-down lists election set to "All".

In the "Narrow Your Search (optional)" section of the "Ad-hoc Event Query Form" page:
22) From the "Scrip number" pull-down list select Scrip 100.

In the "Select Display Options" section of the "Ad-hoc Event Query Form" page:  
23) From the "Number of Results per Page" pull-down list select 2000 (to make sure the query will display all results on one page)

24) Click on the "Search" button. The "Event Query Results" page will be displayed.

25) In the "Event Query Results" page click on the "detail" link for the Scrip 100 event logs retrieved by the event query you just ran. Review the detail event log to verify that Scrip 100 ran successfully.

How to run "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility on-demand, or on a schedule remotely
================================================================================
 
1) Log onto the ASI server (https://asiservername/main )

2) Click on the "Use extended interface" link on the right side of the ASI Dashboard upper pane, below user login and date.

3) At the upper right-hand corner of any page on the ASI server, click on the configuration link in the sites navigation bar (https://asiservername/main/config/index.php?act=site )

4) Click on the "view machines" link for the site where you want to change the local administrator password using the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility. 

5) Since you are changing the local administrator password on all systems at a site using the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility, click on the "configure Scrips" link for any system at the site. Please note that if you want to run an executable on only one system at a site, you should pick that system.

6) Scroll down to the entry for one of Scrips 89, 151-157, or 212-215 (Scheduled Program Execution 1, Scheduled Program Execution 2-5, or Scheduled Program Execution 7-12), and click on the Scrip name. The Scrip configuration page will be displayed.

7) If you want to run the program once, do not enable the Scrip, otherwise click in the "Scrip enabled" box. Since you are changing the local administrator password on all systems at a site, please ensure that "site <name>" from the Group pull-down list for the "Scrip enabled" configuration parameter is on. 

Please note that if you want to run the executable only on the system whose Scrip 89 configuration page you are viewing, select "machine <name>" from the Group pull-down list for the "Scrip enabled" configuration parameter.
In this case, probably you should not enable the program execution Scrip.

8) If the executable you want to run resides on a networked resource, or needs to access a networked resource, click on the "Impersonation enabled" box (you can leave Group selection for the "Impersonation enabled" configuration parameter set to "site <name>"). Please refer to the Scrip 89 (151-157, and 212-215) configuration help file for detailed information and configuration instructions for enabling impersonation support (https://asiservername/main/config/help/s00089.htm ).

In this case, you can ignore the "Impersonation enabled" configuration parameter.

9) If you want to run the program once on-demand, ignore the schedule parameter, otherwise set the schedule as required. For example, if you want to run an executable on Wednesdays at 5.30 AM, you would set the "Minute" field (the first field from the top) to 30, the "Hour" field (the second field) to 5, and the Weekday field (the fifth field) to 3, skipping the Day and Month fields. In all likelihood, you would leave the "Random minute" field (the sixth field) to 0. You would probably also leave the "Type" field (the seventh field) set to 2, unless you wanted the executable to run immediately when the system starts-up in case the system was shut down when the executable was scheduled to run (at 5.30 AM on Wednesdays). If you left the value of the "Fail limit" field (the eight field from the top) set to 0, and the "Type" field set to 2, Scrip 89 (or one of 151-157, or 212-215) would post an event log reporting failure to run because the system was turned off, or the ASI client was not running, the first time such a failure occurs.

IMPORTANT NOTE
---------------
If you enable the Scrip, and assign it a single-event execution schedule in the future (e.g. next Wednesday at 5 AM), please make sure that after Scrip execution occurs as scheduled, you disable the Scrip. Otherwise, it will run EVERY time the one-time execution is scheduled to occur (e.g. Wednesday at 5 AM).


10) In the "Executable" configuration parameter, enter the complete command line for the program, MS-DOS command, batch file, or script you want to run. Please note that you can enter only one command line. If you want to run the command line only on the system where you are configuring the program execution Scrip, select "machine <name>" from the Group pull-down list. Otherwise, select "site <name>". In this case leave the Group parameter pull-down list set to "site <name>".

To use the "cusrmgr.exe" Microsoft utility to change the local administrator password on all systems at a site, you should enter the following command line, setting the Group parameter to "site <name>":

c:\windows\temp\cusrmgr.exe -u Administrator -P <password>

Where you should substitute <password> with the password you want to use of the local administrator.

14) The entry in the "Changed" column for the system you configured Scrip 89 (or one of 151-157, or 212-215) to run the executable on will show the date and time of the action you just took. Before being able to retrieve the program execution Scrip event log reporting completion of the executable processing, you will need to wait until the entry in the "Changed" column changes to "No" (Use the refresh function in your browser). This is dependent on the frequency of execution of Scrip 177 (Scrip Configuration Update). Please refer to the "How to change the frequency with which the ASI client retrieves Scrip configuration changes from the ASI server" section of the "System management, maintenance, and problem management actions" page for instructions on how to change the Scrip 177 execution schedule.

15) As soon as the entry in the "Changed" column for the system you configured the program execution Scrip on changes to "No", click on the "ad-hoc" link in the "events" navigation bar found at the upper right-hand corner of any page on the ASI server (https://asiservername/main/event/event.php). The "Ad-hoc Event Query Form" page will be displayed.

In the "Select Additional Search Criteria for Events" section of the "Ad-hoc Event Query Form" page:

16) From the "Site" pull-down list select the site of the system you configured the program execution Scrip on.
