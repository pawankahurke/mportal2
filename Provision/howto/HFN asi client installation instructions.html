<H3>ASI Client Installation Instructions</H3>
<H4>ASI client interactive installation</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">Below, you will find step-by-step
instructions for installing the ASI client interactively on a new
system. Please refer to the <I>Automated Support Infrastructure
Client Installation User Guide</I> for additional information on the
ASI client installation process. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
must remember the site registration code for the site the system you
are about to install the ASI client on belongs to. If you do not
have, or forget the correct site registration code, you will have to
return to the system at a later date to enter it. Otherwise, you
won't be able to complete deployment of the ASI client on the system.
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Please
note that first-time ASI client installation on a system always
requires the entry of a site registration code, even at sites where
the ASI client is already installed, and the system where the ASI
client is being installed is connected to a sub-net with systems
where the ASI</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana">client is already installed
and running.</FONT> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Please note that as the ASI client runs as a service, first-time
installation on systems running Microsoft Windows NT4, 2000, XP, or
Server 2003 operating systems has to take place with a user with full
administrative rights logged in. Otherwise, the ASI service cannot be
installed, and the ASI client will not run correctly. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run
the ASI client installation executable on the new system. For
example:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">a) Map <A HREF="../How-to">\\server\shared-drive</A>
to the desktop.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">b) Go to Start/Run, and browse to:
<A HREF="//server/shared-drive/HandsFreeNetworks">\\server\shared-drive\HandsFreeNetworks,</A>
and then select the &ldquo;hfn-inst-xxxxxx.exe&rdquo; file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">c) Click on the <B>Next</B> button.
Accept the license. On the last installation screen <B>do not</B>
uncheck the box labeled <I>Launch HandsFree client</I>, just click on
the <B>Finish</B> button. Ignore the message suggesting that you
restart the system.</P>
<P>After execution of the ASI client installation executable on the
new system is completed, and the ASI client starts running, it is in
a <I>dormant</I> configuration with a minimum number of functions
enabled. After an interval that could last as long as 15-30 seconds,
the ASI client generates a dialog box asking for the ten-digit site
registration code.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Registration code entry.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">a) If the site registration code entry
box is empty, enter the correct code, and click on the <B>OK</B>
button.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">b) If a site registration code is
present in the site registration code entry box, and it is the same
as the site registration code of the site you want the new system to
belong to, click on the <B>OK</B> button.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">c) If the site registration code
present in the site registration code entry box is <B>not</B> the
same as the site registration code of the site you want the new
system to belong to, enter the correct site registration code, and
click on the <B>OK</B> button.</P>
<P>The ASI client checks the internal consistency of the site
registration code, using a check digit. If you make a mistake in
entering the code, it keeps asking until it gets a site registration
code that is internally consistent. 
</P>
<H4>Missing registration code</H4>
<P>If you do not have, or do not remember the correct registration
code for the system, the dialog box asking for the registration code
will automatically go away after 60 minutes unless it is canceled
sooner than that. Then, after 15 minutes from the time the dialog box
went away (because of timeout or cancellation) the ASI client will
generate the dialog box asking for a site registration code again.
This cycle is repeated until a valid site registration code is either
entered or approved by a user.</P>
<H4>ASI client command line installation</H4>
<P>You can automate ASI client installation running the The ASI
client installer from a command line using one or more of its command
line parameters. They are:</P>
<P>a) /VERYSILENT</P>
<P>It makes the ASI client installation silent. The only exception
are 
</P>
<P>* The progress dialog boxes displayed when the ASI network driver
is installed for the first time on Microsoft Windows NT4 systems
during the &quot;driver binding&quot; step that occurs twice.</P>
<P>* The system function that installs the driver on Microsoft
Windows 2000, XP, or Server 2003 displays progress dialog boxes about
the copy of the driver files. These appear only for a few seconds (in
some cases less than one second).</P>
<P>Both types of dialog boxes above are system dialog boxes and are
therefore unaffected by the /VERYSILENT command line switch of the
installer.</P>
<P>b) /ID=XXXXXXXXXX</P>
<P>It lets you enter the registration code for a site in the
installer's command line eliminating the need for any user
interaction. The letters in ID are not case sensitive. You can have
iD, Id, id etc... There should not be any spaces in the string. There
should only be a space that separates the name of the ASI client
installation executable file from the command line argument. 
</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P>hfn-inst-160665.exe /ID=XXXXXXXXXX</P>
<P>c) /CI controlling the request of end-user contact information</P>
<P>Adding /CI=1 variable to the ASI client installation executable
command line will cause the ASI client to generate a dialog box, as
soon as the installation process is completed, asking a system's user
to enter the contact information you selected when you configured
Scrip 241. By default, the only information requested is first name
and last name. Using /CI=0 prevents the request for contact
information explicitly. Not including the /CI variable in the ASI
client installation executable command line is equivalent to using
/CI=0. CI stands for &quot;contact information&quot;. The letters in
CI are not case sensitive.</P>
<P>Please note that regardless of whether you use the CI command line
variable at installation time or not, you can always ask for an
end-user's contact information at any time by running Scrip 241 on
demand. Doing this will cause Scrip 241 to generate a dialog box
requesting the contact information. Please refer to the Scrip 241
configuration help file for detailed information about Scrip 241.</P>
<P>d) /DEPLOY controlling the ASI client network deployment function
(Scrip 111) -- CASE SENSITIVE</P>
<P>/DEPLOY=1 enables the HandsFree network deployment function at
start-up.</P>
<P>/DEPLOY=0 disables the HandsFree network deployment function at
start-up. You can run it later by directly accessing the Scrip 111
configuration page (not using a /DEPLOY command line option has the
same effect as using /DEPLOY=0).</P>
<P>If you used the /DEPLOY=1 command line option when running the ASI
client installation executable, the ASI client network deployment
function (Scrip 111) will run on ASI client startup. Upon (one-time)
execution, Scrip 111 generates a dialog box with three text fields.
In these text fields you enter the user name, domain, and password
for a user with administrative rights on all systems where you want
the ASI client installed. Once the requested information is entered,
and you click on the &quot;OK&quot; button, the Scrip will initiate
ASI client deployment on the sub-net. The dialog box generated by
Scrip 111 persists until you enter the requested information, and
click on the &quot;OK&quot; button, or click on the &quot;Cancel&quot;
button.</P>
<P>e) /NDS controlling the installation of the ASI network driver</P>
<P>/NDS=0</P>
<P>If present in the ASI client installation executable command line,
the /NDS=0 switch will prevent the installation of the ASI network
driver on systems where the ASI client is not yet installed, or where
the ASI network driver was not previously installed. On systems where
the ASI network driver is installed, using the /NDS=0 switch in the
ASI client installation executable command line will result in the
removal of the ASI network driver. The letters in NDS are not case
sensitive. 
</P>
<P>PLEASE NOTE THAT REMOVING THE ASI NETWORK DRIVER FROM A SYSTEM
WHERE IT SI ALREADY INSTALLED WILL CAUSE THE NETWORK CONNECTIONS ON
THE SYSTEM WHERE IT IS BEING REMOVED FROM TO BE RESET. THIS ACTION IS
PERFORMED BY THE OPERATING SYSTEM INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY ACTION TAKEN
BY THE ASI SOFTWARE.</P>
<P>/NDS=1</P>
<P>If present in the ASI client installation executable command line,
the /NDS=1 switch will force the installation of the ASI network
driver on systems where the ASI client is not yet installed, or where
the ASI network driver was not previously installed. The letters in
NDS are not case sensitive.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P>hfn-inst-173228.exe /NDS=0</P>
<P>If neither the /NDS=0 or /NDS=1 options are used, the ASI client
installation executable will install the ASI network driver on
systems where the ASI client was not previously installed, and on
system where the ASI client is already installed it will leave the
ASI client in its current state with regard to the ASI network
driver.</P>
<P>The /VERYSILENT, /ID, /CI, /DEPLOY, and /NDS=0 command switches
can be used in the same command line. When using any of the ASI
client installer command line switches, there should not be any
spaces in the command line switch string. There should only be a
space separating the name of the ASI client installation executable
file from the command line argument, and the command line switches
from each other, if you are using more than one. 
</P>
<H4>ASI client installation completion</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Once
you have entered the ten-digit site registration code directly or via
command line execution, The ASI client contacts the ASI installation
server (the server you accessed to set up the site record for the
site your are installing the ASI client at, and which generated the
site&rsquo;s unique 10-digit registration code) asking for the site
installation and deployment information. This is the information you
entered when you created the record for this site. This information
allows the ASI client to be activated for operational use. </FONT>
</P>
<H4>ASI client upgrades</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">When
running the ASI client installation executable on systems where the
ASI client is already installed only the information in the <I>ASI
client command line installation</I> section of this document
applies.</FONT></P>
