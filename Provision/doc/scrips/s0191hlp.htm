<H3>Scrip 191 - TCP/IP Connectivity Problem Management </H3>

<P>Scrip 191 detects, diagnoses, and manages the resolution of TCP/IP connectivity problems.</P>

<p>Failure points covered by Scrip 191 include:</p>

<UL>
  <LI>Local connectivity</LI>
  <LI>Internet access gateway</LI>
  <LI>DNS server</LI>
  <LI>Target service port - Scrip 191 covers ALL TCP/IP ports / services</LI>
</UL>

<p>Scrip 191 uses the ASI network driver to detect and diagnose TCP/IP connectivity problems on all ports,
at a low level before they are detected by application software.</p>

<P>If the port of the service which failed is
included in the <em>User Interface enabled on failure of these ports</em> list,
Scrip 191 will inform the end-user about the problem with three dialog boxes:</p>

<ul>
<li>One dialog box that informs the user that a connectivity problem occurred</li>
<li>A second dialog box that tells the end-user which problem occurred, and offers to notify him/her
when the service is available again, and</li>
<li>If the end user clicked on the "OK" button in the second dialog box,
a third dialog box that will notify the user that the failed service is back online.</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of notifications about the availability of a service generated by Scrip 191 is
a configurable parameter you can set in the Scrip's configuration page. If the service
whose availability is being monitored is not back online when the number of notifications is exceeded,
Scrip 191 will display a last message with instructions to the end-user on what to do next.
The content of this message is also a configurable parameter that you can access via the
Scrip's configuration page.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
