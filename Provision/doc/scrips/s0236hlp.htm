<H3>Scrip 236 &ndash; <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#333399">On-demand
Remote Control</FONT></FONT></H3>
<H4>Overview</H4>
<P>Scrip 236 extends remote system control capabilities in a number
of significant ways:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>It lets users control computers remotely without end-user
	intervention. This makes it ideal for remote control of unattended
	systems, e.g. servers.</P>
	<LI><P>All aspects of remote control operations can be performed on
	demand, individually and in combination. This means that you can use
	Scrip 236 to install/remove the remote control utility,
	initiate/terminate a remote control session, or both
	(install/initiate a session, shutdown/remove) at any time.</P>
	<LI><P>Scrip 236 brings scalability to remote control. The
	installation/removal of remote control software on one, some, or all
	systems on a sub-net is completely automated and managed via a
	single Scrip configuration page.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.18in">You can also initiate remote control
sessions on one, some or all systems on a sub-net with the click of a
button on one system.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>With Scrip 236 remote control sessions are more secure:</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The remote control session is initiated as an outbound
	transaction by the system you want to work on. This means that there
	is no need to open any ports for inbound traffic, which would pose a
	significant security risk.</P>
	<LI><P>Scrip 236 can be configured to automatically remove the
	remote control utility as soon as a remote control session is
	completed</P>
	<LI><P>There are no servers outside of your control that are used as
	intermediaries</P>
	<LI><P>The remote control session is completely self-contained every
	aspect of it is under your control including the installation and
	removal of the remote control utility</P>
</UL>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Scrip 236 is designed to be used with any remote control
	utility. <A HREF="mailto:Ultr@VNC">Ultr@VNC</A> is the one initially
	supported both because it is popular, and it is open source</P>
</UL>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4>How it works</H4>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Scrip 236 performs four tasks:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Installation and removal of the remote control utility (in
	the first version, VNC is the only supported remote control utility)</P>
	<LI><P>Initiation and termination of a remote control session</P>
</UL>
<P>Each task can be performed individually giving you flexibility on
their sequence. For example, you could instruct Scrip 236 to install
the remote control utility and begin a remote control session either
immediately or at a different time. Depending on your choice, removal
of the remote control utility can occur either right after a remote
control session is over or at a later time.</P>
<P>You can perform both the installation and session initiation tasks
in one step. You can also configure Scrip 236 to automatically remove
the remote control utility as soon as the remote control session is
completed.</P>
<P>When instructed to install the remote control utility, Scrip 236
downloads the software&rsquo;s installation executable from a URL of
your choice. You can use an HTTP/HTTPS server, and FTP server, or
shared network resource.</P>
<P>For your convenience, HandsFree Networks has placed the
installation executable for <A HREF="mailto:Ultr@VNC">Ultr@VNC</A> at
<A HREF="http://www.handsfreenetworks.com/download/UltraVNC--100-RC11d-Setup.exe">http://www.handsfreenetworks.com/download/UltraVNC--100-RC11d-Setup.exe</A></P>
