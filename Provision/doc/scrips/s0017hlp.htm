<H3>Scrip 17 - Executable Detected</H3>

<P>Scrip 17 detects and reports the execution of programs included in the 
<em>Executables to detect</em> list in its configuration file.</p>

<p>In some cases, executables whose execution you may want to detect are entered as parameters in 
the command line of a script or another executable.</p>

<p>For this reason, you can also enter the name of the executable in the 
<em>Command Line arguments to detect</em> list in Scrip 17's configuration file.</p>

<p>Note that <em>Command Line arguments to detect</em> entries don't have to be executables. 
You could use this parameter to enter any sequence of characters in the command line 
of an executable you want the Scrip to detect.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
