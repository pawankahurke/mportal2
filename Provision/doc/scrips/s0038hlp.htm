<H3>Scrip 38 - Fault Detected</H3>

<P>Scrip 38 detects and reports faults. It provides detailed information about processes running 
on the system at the time of the fault. Scrip 38's output also includes the User Action Log (UAL).</p>

<p>The UAL contains a description of a user's 50 actions that preceded a fault. 
It captures a number of different types of actions, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running a program</li>
<li>Dialog box creation</li>
<li>Clicking on a button</li>
<li>Selecting a menu item</li>
<li>Entering text in a text box</li>
<li>Shifting focus of top level window</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that the current version of Scrip 38 does not 
detect Microsoft Windows kernel faults, the ones that generate a blue screen.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
