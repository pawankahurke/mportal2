<H3>Scrip 189 - File Download Blocking</H3>

<P>Scrip 189 can be used to block downloading of files on a system.
You can enter the types of files, or specific files, whose download 
you want Scrip 189 to prevent using the Scrip configuration facility.</p>


<p>Files whose download is prevented are replaced with a file whose name you enter in Scrip 189's configuration page.</p>

<p>If no such file name is entered, the file whose download was prevented is replaced with a file whose content
is zeros.</p>


<p><strong>It's important to note that Scrip 189 only replaces the content of the file whose download was blocked,
not its name. Unless the end-user is informed on a timely basis that the file download filtering is enabled,
this can lead to repeated attempts to download a file, and
consequent frustration on the part of the end-user.</strong></p>

<p>To minimize the potential for this to happen, we have included in the ASI client directory a
small program called block.exe (also in zipped form, block.zip) that when executed informs the end user
about the file download blocking policy in effect with the following statement:<br><br>
<em>"Sorry, per company policy download of this file type is not allowed.
Please contact your system administrator with any questions. Thank you."<em><br><br>
<p>You can use block.exe, or block.zip as the files that replace blocked files when
blocking files of types .exe, or .zip, respectively.</p>
