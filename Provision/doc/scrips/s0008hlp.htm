<H3>Scrip 8 - Orphaned Log File Sent as Attachment</H3>

<P>Scrip 8 detects whether there are any files in the "temp" directory
of the Client folder that aren't scheduled to be sent via e-mail. 
If there are any, it attaches them to an e-mail log, which causes them to be deleted when they
are sent.  This is helpful in diagnosing failures in the e-mail logging
mechanism which cause logs to not be sent.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
