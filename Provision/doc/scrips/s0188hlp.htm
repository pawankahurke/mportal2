<H3>Scrip 188 - Email Attachment Filtering</H3>

<P>Scrip 188 can be used to delete attachments from messages received on a system.
You can enter the types of files you want Scrip 188 to delete using the Scrip configuration facility.</p>


<p>Attachments that are removed are replaced with a text file with the following content:</p>

<p><strong>The file attached to this message that was
originally named "[file name]" has been removed due
to the filtering policy set up by your system administrator.</strong></p>

<p>Because Scrip 188 operates on the system where the ASI client is installed, it protects systems
from potentially damaging attachments arriving from either POP based mail services, or Web based mail services
(e.g. AOL Mail, Yahoo Mail, and Hotmail).</p>

<p>Local execution of Scrip 188 also makes it possible to customize attachment filtering policies on a
system-by-system basis, or for subsets of systems.</p>


<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
