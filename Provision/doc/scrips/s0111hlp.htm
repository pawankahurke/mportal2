<H3>Scrip 111 &ndash; HandsFree Client Network Deployment</H3>
<P>Scrip 111 automatically installs the ASI client on all systems on
the sub-net where the system on which Scrip 111 ran is located.</P>
<P>Whenever it runs, Scrip 111 either runs a networks survey (the
first time it runs), or updates a network survey. Please note that
you can also run the network survey action independently of the ASI
client deployment action by clicking on the <I>Run network survey now</I>
Execute button in the Scrip's configuration page. 
</P>
<P>Whenever it runs, Scrip 111 generates a log reporting the actions
it took and the contents of the survey of all network devices for
which it found information in the system's ARP table, including
additional information it retrieves from the devices directly.</P>
<H4>HandsFree client network deployment function restrictions</H4>
<P>Scrip 111 works on systems running a version of the Microsoft
Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, and Vista operating systems.</P>
<P>At locations where systems are running a version of the Microsoft
Windows XP operating system, the HandsFree client network deployment
function (Scrip 111) works if:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Systems are in a domain</P>
	<LI><P>File and print sharing is enabled</P>
</UL>
<P>Please note the above restrictions apply only to systems running
Microsoft Windows XP.</P>
<P>On sub-nets where systems running Microsoft Windows XP are not in
a domain, in order for the HandsFree Client network deployment
function to work, the following conditions must be met:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Simple file sharing is disabled</P>
	<LI><P>The Microsoft XP firewall is configured to allow file and
	print sharing</P>
</UL>
<P>In addition to the above, In order to use the HandsFree client
network deployment, you will need to provide a user name and password
for an administrative account that works on all systems on the
sub-net. If this is a domain account, you will also need to provide
the domain name for the account. You will also need to check and make
sure that the system you run the HandsFree network deployment
function on is a member of the domain where you want to install the
ASI client.</P>
<H4>Network survey output explained</H4>
<P>For each system on the sub-net where the system on which Scrip 111
runs is located, Scrip 111 will report information as in the
following example:</P>
<P><I>Name</I>: MNMS</P>
<P><I>IP Address</I>: 192.168.0.36</P>
<P><I>MAC Address</I>: 00:20:AF:CD:72:46</P>
<P><I>Time</I>: 04/06/2007 13:40:38</P>
<P><I>Client</I>: none</P>
<P><I>Testing for Network Share</I>: \\MNMS\C$\Program Files</P>
<P><I>Error</I>: Bad network path.</P>
<P><I>Last changed from</I>: 04/04/2007 12:32:56 to: 04/06/2007
13:40:38</P>
<P>Below, you will find an explanation of the content of the network
survey produced by Scrip 111.</P>
<P><I>Name</I> - NetBIOS name of the system surveyedIP address - IP
address of system being surveyed</P>
<P><I>MAC address</I> - MAC address of network interface card where
the TCP/IP connection to the sub-net on the system being surveyed is
enabled and active.</P>
<P><I>Time</I> - The time at which the system being surveyed (in this
example MNMS) was seen by the ASI client. The time field reports when
the machine was added to the ARP table of the system where Scrip 111
ran. When the ASI client re-starts, it re-detects the ARP table. At
that time, it re-detects the machine again, and sets the new time in
its ARP table copy. The information in the log reports this change in
time.</P>
<P><I>Client</I> - The version of the client if it can be acquired at
the time of the survey.</P>
<P><I>Testing for Network Share</I> - The ASI client looks for the
&quot;Programs Files&quot; directory on available network shares.
This field shows the path that the ASI client used when it checked
for the &quot;Program Files&quot; directory.</P>
<P>The result of network share test can be:</P>
<P>- <B>Directory exists.</B> or 
</P>
<P>- <B>Error:</B> followed by one of the following error messages: 
</P>
<P><B>Error: Directory does not exist.</B> 
</P>
<P>The ASI client was able to access the network share but the
directory didn't exist. In this case the ASI client will attempt to
test network share D$\ etc...</P>
<P><B>Error: Bad network path.</B> 
</P>
<P>This error occurs when:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The system being surveyed is turned off.</P>
	<LI><P>The system being surveyed doesn't have Microsoft Windows
	installed.</P>
	<LI><P>When a firewall is blocking file and printer sharing.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Error: Bad network password.</B> 
</P>
<P>This error is reported when the password entered for the
administrative user does not work.</P>
<P><B>Error: Access denied.</B> 
</P>
<P>Typically, this error is reported when one or more of the
following is true:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>&quot;Simple file sharing&quot; is enabled on the system
	being surveyed</P>
	<LI><P>The administrative user account whose credentials you have
	entered does not exist</P>
	<LI><P>File and print sharing for Microsoft networks is not enabled</P>
	<LI><P>The file and print sharing exception in the Microsoft XP
	firewall has not been enabled.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Error: Bad network name.</B> 
</P>
<P>This error occurs when the network share has been removed from the
system being surveyed.</P>
<P><B>The network request is not supported</B></P>
<P>This error occurs when the device contacted by Scrip 111 although
it is a valid IP device does not appear to run an operating system
which supports the system access request performed by Scrip 111.</P>
<P><B>Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.</B> 
</P>
<P>This error is reported when the administrative user credentials
either are incorrect, or the administrative user whose credentials
you have entered is not active on the system being surveyed.</P>
<H5>Network changes</H5>
<P>After you trigger execution of the HandsFree client network
deployment function (Scrip 111) either by using the /DEPLOY=1 ASI
client installation executable command line option, or on demand by
clicking on the Begin auto deploy Execute button in the Scrip 111
configuration page, the Scrip will run once, execute a network survey
and beginning the ASI client installation on systems in the sub-net. 
</P>
<P>After the initial execution, Scrip 111 will run every time a new
device is added to the ARP table on the system where Scrip execution
was triggered. 
</P>
<P>If you change the configuration of the network where you ran the
HandsFree network deployment function in a way which you think may
affect the ASI client deployment, you should run the HandsFree client
network deployment function again on demand by clicking on the Begin
auto deploy Execute button in the Scrip 111 configuration page.</P>
<P>When Scrip 111 runs a second time, it will update the network
survey, and report changes it finds with messages such as the
following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Version installed changed from: 2.004.026.0177.00 to:
	2.004.026.0182.00</B> 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>or 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>NetBIOS name changed from: 192.168.0.116 to: AWIN</B> 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The two messages above are examples of changes in the network
environment reported by Scrip 111. In the first case the ASI client
was upgraded. In the second case Scrip 111 was able to resolve
192.168.0.116 to AWIN, the NetBIOS name of the system being surveyed.</P>
<P>Here is another example of the kinds of changes reported by Scrip
111 when it runs. On the system listed below the ASI client was
removed, and the system was re-started. When Scrip 111 ran the
network survey after the ASI client was removed from the system, it
detected the fact that the ASI client was removed, and that the DHCP
server assigned a new IP address.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in"><B>IP address changed from:
