<H3>Scrip 86 - Synchronization of System Clock with Time Server </H3>

<P>Scrip 86 synchronizes a system's clock in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>Using HCP from the system where the ASI log server is located (this is the default option)</li>

<li>Accessing a certified time server on the Internet.
It uses port 37 to access the following time servers to adjust a system's clock:</li>

<ul>
<li>time.nist.gov</li>
<li>time-a.nist.gov</li>
<li>time-nw.nist.gov</li>
<li>ntp2.usno.navy.mil</li>
</ul>

<p>In case of failure to reach the first time server on the list above, it will attempt to
reach the others in sequential order (i.e. 2<SUP>nd</SUP>, 3<SUP>rd</SUP>, etc., etc.)
If none of the time servers is available, the synchronization operation will be attempted again
the next time Scrip 86 is scheduled to run.</p>

<p>You can modify the list of time servers used by Scrip 86,
adding or deleting time servers.</p>

</ul>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
