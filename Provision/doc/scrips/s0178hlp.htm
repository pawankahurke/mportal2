<H3>Scrip 178 - Microsoft Windows Networking Denied Access </H3>

<P>Scrip 178 detects failure to access a shared resource on the network because access was denied. Typically, this happens when the wrong password is used to access the shared resource.</P>

<p>This Scrip can be a useful tool for detecting and tracking potentially unauthorized attempts to access a shared resource.</p>

<p>Scrip 178 is triggered on the system where the shared resource is located when it detects an <strong>access denied</strong> error code at the SMB protocol level.</p>


<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
