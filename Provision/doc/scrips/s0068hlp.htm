<H3>Scrip 68 - User Has Changed System Date and Time</H3>

<P>Scrip 68 detect and reports a user-produced change of system date and/or time. It takes no corrective action automatically 
because it does not presume that the change in system date and/or time was unintentional.</p>

<p>However, if the user interface feature is enabled when a user changes the system date and/or time, a dialog box 
will pop up listing the original and new time and date, and asking:<br><br>
<em>"Did you mean to change the time?"</em><br><br>
seeking a <strong>Yes/No</strong> response.</p>

<p>If the user interface is not enabled, Scrip 68 will detect the date/time change but
will not take any action to reset it.</p>

<p>Scrip 68 also compares the time zone of the system on which it was triggered with that of the other systems on
the local network where the ASI client is active reporting any discrepancy and listing each system with its time  zone.</p>

<p>Scrip 68 detects date/time changes of more than five hours.
Any date/time change of five hours or less will be ignored.</p>

<p>Please note that Scrip 68 is triggered when a user accesses the calendar on his/her system by 
double-clicking on the time display at the lower right-hand corner of the system's desktop. 
When this happens Scrip 68 will report any date and/or time discrepancy, as discussed above, and 
time zone differences among systems on the local network.</p>

<p>This means that even if the user does not change the time or date on his/her system, 
if there are differences in time zones among systems on the local network, Scrip 68 will 
report these differences as long as they persist.</p>
