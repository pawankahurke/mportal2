<H3>Scrip 43 - HandsFree Client Tools</H3>
<P>Scrip 43 performs five functions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>ASI client configuration 
	</P>
	<P>Via the Scrip 43 configuration page you can change all ASI client
	configuration parameters including the user id and password used to
	access the Scrip configurator directly, on a system-by-system basis.
	This means that security policies for accessing the Scrip
	configurator can match those you use for your organization as a
	whole.</P>
	<P>Scrip 43 lets you also change the name of a site. We strongly
	advise against doing this because it would be difficult for you to
	uniformity of site name particularly where systems belonging to a
	site are distributed across multiple local networks over a widely
	distributed area, or simply consist of remotely connected and/or
	mobile systems.</P>
	<P>Additional complexity comes from having to make sure that when
	you change the name of the site via Scrip 43, the site parameter is
	set to global, or local, as needed, otherwise you would end up with
	systems reporting incorrect site information.</P>
	<P>If you want to change the name of a site, the easiest and
	simplest way to do it is to change the site's name in its profile on
	the ASI installation management facility. Doing it this way, avoids
	all the issues described in the two paragraphs above.</P>
	<P>Please refer to the Scrip 43 configuration help files for a
	detailed description of all ASI client configuration parameters, and
	instructions on how to change them, if necessary.</P>
	<LI><P>Impersonation management 
	</P>
	<P>On NT based systems (MS Windows NT4, 2000, XP, and Server 2003)
	the ASI client is logged in as local system administrator. This
	means that it cannot access shared resources on the local network.</P>
	<P>In order to enable ASI client's access to shared resources on the
	local network, we have implemented impersonation. Impersonation lets
	the ASI client log onto the system where the shared resource is
	located as a user known by that system enabling it to access that
	shared resource.</P>
	<P>You manage a site's impersonation settings including user id,
	password, and domain, if one is needed, via the impersonation
	parameters in the Scrip 43 configuration page.</P>
	<LI><P>ASI client configuration maintenance</P>
	<P>Scrip 43 lets you perform a number of ASI client confiiguration
	maintenance functions including clearing and resetting of the
	configuration database, generating a new system UUID (unique
	universal identifier), and changing a system's site registration
	code.</P>
	<LI><P>ASI client diagnostic information management 
	</P>
	<P>By simply checking boxes for the diagnostic information you need,
	and clicking on a few buttons, Scrip 43 will deliver to the ASI
	server in-depth diagnostic and error trace information from one,
	some, or all systems at a site. The diagnostic information logs
	produced include:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Dumps of information related to
		the operation of the Automated Support Infrastructure (ASI) Client.
		Dumps produced are: 
		</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Comm Dump: A list a recent
			network communications between clients and or the server. 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alist Dump: A list of recent
			calls to add and remove machines from the client machine list. 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sync Dump: A list of sync
			objects in use. Used in client resource management. 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Scrip Dump: A list of recently
			executed scrips, scrips currently being executed, and scrips
			waiting to be run. 
			</P>
			<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Timer Dump: A list of scrips in
			the timer queue scheduled to be run. 
			</P>
		</UL>
		<LI><P>Error log files 
		</P>
	</UL>
	<P>Scrip 43 posts dumps and error log files onto the event log
	database on the ASI server as SSL HTTP logs sent via port 80.
	Alternatively, it can also send dumps and error log files via
	e-mail.</P>
	<LI><P>ASI client uninstall 
	</P>
	<P>Scrip 43 lets you remove the ASI Client from the system where the
	Scrip 43 configuration page is being accessed. Removal can be
	silent. ASI client uninstall is not a site wide operation. This
	minimizes the risk of unintentionally removing the ASI client from
	an entire site.</P>
</UL>
