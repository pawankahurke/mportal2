<H3>Scrip 16 - File / Folder Deletion Dialog Box Creation</H3>

<P>Scrip 16 detects and reports a user's attempt to delete MS Internet Explorer-related 
history or cookie files.</p>

<p>It does not report whether the attempted deletion was completed or the user chose to cancel 
the operation.</p>

<p>Scrip 16 will not detect an attempted deletion of the entire Internet Explorer 
History or Cookie folders located in the MS Windows directory. It would be detected by Scrip 21.</p>

<p>This Scrip is triggered by one of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempted deletion of an Internet Explorer history file located in the folder \Windows\History 
accessed directly either through "My Computer" or Windows Explorer.</li>
<li>Attemtped deletion of an Internet Explorer history file accessed through Internet Explorer, by 
clicking on <strong>View</strong>, <strong>Explorer Bar</strong>, <strong>History</strong>, 
or by clicking on the <strong>History</strong> icon on the Internet Explorer toolbar.</li>
<li>Attempted deletion of an Internet Explorer cookie file accessed through Internet Explorer, by 
clicking on <strong>Tools</strong>, <strong>Internet Options</strong>, <strong>Settings</strong>, 
in the Temporary Internet Files section, and
<strong>View Files</strong>.</li>
</ul>
