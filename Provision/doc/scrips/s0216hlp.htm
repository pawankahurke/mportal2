<H3>Scrip 216 - Print Queue Problem Resolution</H3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>The print queue problem resolution Scrip monitors print queues on
systems that have an attached printer, or send jobs to be printed on a
network printer. When the Scrip is enabled, it logs a system's printer
configuration every time the ASI client is restarted. The Scrip performs
two main tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monitor print queues, detect all jobs being printed, and report their status</li>
<li>Detect print jobs that are stuck in the process of being printed,
stop the print queue, remove them, and re-start the print queue enabling
other print jobs, if any, to be printed. Problem resolution is triggered
when the the maximum time that a job can be in the process of being
printed, as set by IT personnel, is exceeded.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Automated print queue problem resolution</h4>

<p>When the <em>Automated print queue problem resolution enabled</em> option is enabled,
Scrip 216 will perform problem resolution whenever a job has been in the process of being printed
for an amount of time equal, or in excess of the amount of time you specify in the
<em>How long should the scrip wait for a job to be in process before running automated problem resolution?
(enter time in minutes)</em>. parameter.</p>

<p>Problem resolution takes place in three phases. Depending on the
severity of the problem, the Scrip's actions escalate as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Level I - The Scrip detects the problem and uses spooler functionality
to attempt to remove the job that's causing the problem from the queue
while preserving the other jobs in the queue.

The problem resolution steps carried out are:</li>

<ul>
<li>Shut down of print spooler</li>
<li>Re-start of print spooler</li>
</ul><br>



<li>Level II - If Level I resolution does not resolve the problem, the Scrip
performs the print job removal action directly, while still leaving
untouched the other jobs in the queue.

The problem resolution steps carried out are:</li>

<ul>
<li>Shut down of print spooler</li>
<li>Deletion of job that has been in the process being printed for an amount of time equal to, or in excess of the amount of time calculated using the values entered in parameters <em>Printing speed (pages per minute)</em>, <em>Percent time added per print job</em>, <em>Fixed time added per print job (minutes)</em>, and <em>Print job sensitivity</em>, print queue problem resolution is triggered.</p></li>
<li>Re-start of print spooler</li>
</ul><br>



<li>Level III - If the problem keeps recurring on the same queue, the Scrip
restarts the system where the problem occurs (the problem may be caused
by the print driver and restarting a system resolves most print driver
related problems). Because this action, unlike the others, is very
intrusive, level III problem resolution has to be explicitly enabled by
IT personnel. If it is enabled, before restarting the system, and the
<em>Third level problem resolution user interface enabled</em> option is enabled, the Scrip
will display a dialog box explaining to the user the reason for having
to restart the system and asking the end-user to authorize system
re-start via a yes/no dialog box. If the user clicks on the no button or
ignores the dialog box, the Scrip will not restart the system. If the
printing problem occurs again soon after, the Scrip will once again ask
the user for permission to restart the system.<br>
If the <em>Third level problem resolution user interface enabled</em> option is not enabled, Scrip 216
will perform third level problem resolution directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>When Scrip 216 is enabled, every time the ASI client is restarted, it reports here the printers it monitors and
the basic print queue configuration settings. In case monitoring of a printer could not start, Scrip 216
reports the event.</p>

<P>Spooler service is installed
<br>Print Spooler is running
<br>Monitoring printer: HP OfficeJet G95
<br>"Keep printed documents" for printer HP OfficeJet G95 is enabled
<br>Monitoring printer: HP LaserJet 4000 Series PCL6
