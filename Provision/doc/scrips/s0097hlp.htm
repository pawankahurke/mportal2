<H3>Scrip 97 - Physical Disk Statistics</H3>

<P>Scrip 97 reports physical disk statistics. These statistics are available only for 
Windows NT (NT4, 2000, and XP) systems. For each physical disk, the following statistics 
are reported:
</p>

<ul>

<li>Percent busy time (%)

<li>Reads (per second)

<li>Writes (per second)

<li>Average queue length (items)

</ul>

<p>

Note that all of these statistics must be averaged over a specific
time period called the Sampling Period. That time period (in mSec) is one of Scrip 97's 
configuration parameters.

</p>


<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
