<H3>Scrip 232 &ndash; <FONT FACE="verdana, helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#333399">Intrusion
Protection Management</FONT></FONT></H3>
<H4>Overview</H4>
<P>Scrip 232 detects attempted configuration changes that can be used
to execute unauthorized or malicious code. It can be configured to
disable or delete these changes automatically without end-user
intervention. If the user interface option is enabled, it alerts the
end-user of such system configuration changes giving him/her the
option to reject, disable (for future re-enabling if desired), or
accept such changes.</P>
<P>The areas monitored by Scrip 232 are ones that are not normally
covered by anti-virus and most other intrusion protection software.
Scrip 232 focuses particularly on how a virus or other unauthorized
code may be re-activated after an end-user or system administrator
tries to terminate its execution and remove it. Typically, if an
end-user or system administrator discovers an unauthorized executable
running they may shut down the application, remove it, and possibly
remove an entry for it from the system registry. 
</P>
<P>However it is possible, using shell extension handlers for
example, to run a program every time a user right-clicks on a file
which checks to see if the <I>rogue</I> application is installed and
running, and if not, re-installs it and re-runs it. This type of
re-activation can be very difficult to track down. 
</P>
<P>Malicious code can also be run at startup by using the Run
registry keys, the startup folders, system.ini and win.ini. Scrip 27,
(System Start-up Executable Management) protects these areas from
intrusion. Though autoexec.bat can be used to run code at startup,
currently it's rarely used to do so. In autoexec.bat, we're more
interested here in protecting the contents of the PATH environment
variable. <I>Rogue</I> applications can use it to run unauthorized
code. The system areas and object types currently protected by Scrip
232 include:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Autoexec.bat</P>
	<LI><P>Shell extension handlers</P>
	<LI><P>Screen savers</P>
	<LI><P><EM>Open</EM> verb's command default value for executable
	files</P>
	<LI><P>The <EM>Shell</EM> and <EM>Userinit</EM> values for the
	Winlogon key</P>
	<LI><P><EM>RunOnce</EM>, <EM>RunOnceEx</EM>, and <EM>RunServicesOnce</EM>
	registry keys</P>
	<LI><P>Scrap Objects</P>
</UL>
<H4>How it works</H4>
<P>Scrip 232 creates a hidden directory in the client dir called
&quot;232&quot;. When the scrip first runs it creates in this hidden
directory backup files of autoexec.bat, explorer.exe, and
userinit.exe, using the .bak extension. Scrip 232 watches these files
for tampering using checksums and should one of these files change
the backup file in the hidden directory will be restored if the
change is rejected (either silently, by dialog box timeout, or by
user action). If a file changes and the change is accepted then the
backup file is updated.</P>
<P>Further, if one of these files change and the chosen action is
&quot;Disable&quot; then in addition to the backup file being
restored the &quot;disabled&quot; version is archived in the hidden
directory with the extension dbl. This is so a system administrator
could examine the changed file after the backup is restored.</P>
<H4>Scrip 232 coverage areas detail</H4>
<P>In this section we describe in some detail the areas and object
Scrip 232 protects from intrusion. For additional information on why
and how configuration changes in these areas, and changes to these
objects, can cause the execution of malicious code please refer to
the article by Jason Fisher titled &quot;Understand Common Virus
Attacks Before They Strike to Better Protect Your Apps&quot; at the
following URL:</P>
<P><A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/05/VirusHunting/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/05/VirusHunting/default.aspx</A></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Autoexec.bat</FONT></EM> can be
	used to run executable files on startup so we'll use a checksum to
	watch for changes in this config file. Also, the modification of the
	PATH environment variable is perhaps even more insidious than
	running executable code directly because it's less likely to be
	noticed as a potential risk. For example, when Microsoft Windows NT
	starts up it runs explorer.exe as the shell. This is because the
	&quot;Shell&quot; value of the &quot;Winlogon&quot; key is set to
	&quot;explorer.exe&quot;. Now explorer.exe can't be replaced with a
	copy while Windows NT is running because it's protected by an
	operating system lock. However, there is no path given in the
	registry, so someone could replace explorer.exe with a copy stored
	somewhere on the system, and change the PATH variable so that Winds
	NT uses the copy instead of the original. What's worse is that the
	real explorer.exe is no longer protected by an operating system lock
	so it can now be overwritten. &nbsp;</P>
	<LI><P><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Shell extension handlers</FONT></EM>
	(DLLs) can be set to run whenever any number of shell actions are
	initiated by the user, such as right clicking on an object to bring
	up the context menu or dragging and dropping. Since these handlers
	can execute malicious code, Scrip 232 monitord this area of the
	registry detecting (and rejecting/disabling them if so configured)
	any new ones that are installed and registered.</P>
	<LI><P><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Screen savers</FONT></EM> are
	standalone executable files. They can run malicious code when they
	are activated, or even if the user merely previews them. &nbsp;</P>
	<LI><P><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Open verb's command default
	value</FONT></EM>. There is a list of executable files (.exe, .com,
	.bat, etc.) that will run if the user double-clicks them. This is
	because their &quot;open&quot; verb's command default value in the
	registry is &quot;%1&quot; %*. These registry values can be changed
	to something like &quot;VirusExecutable.exe %1&quot;. The result, as
	explained by Jason Fisher, would be this: &quot;This allowed the
	virus program to run first any time the user attempted to execute
	any EXE program. The requested program was passed to the virus
	executable as a parameter, whereupon the virus could launch it,
	keeping the user largely in the dark about what was really going
	on.&quot; Scrip 232 monitors the open command's default value for
	executable files for attempts to modify them (rejecting/disabling
	them if so configured).</P>
	<LI><P><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">The &quot;Shell&quot; and
	&quot;Userinit&quot; values for the registry key &quot;Winlogon&quot;</FONT></EM>
	contains the name of executable files that are executed whenever a
	user logs on. The &quot;Shell&quot; value runs explorer.exe.
	&quot;Userinit&quot; runs userinit.exe on Microsoft Windows 2000, XP
	and 2003, and userinit.exe and nddeagnt.exe on systems running
	Microsoft Windows NT4. Scrip 232 monitors &ldquo;Shell&rdquo; and
	Userinit&rdquo;. If so configured, it prevents them from being
	changed and, as further protection, records the checksums of the
	.exe files in case they get replaced with copies with the same name.</P>
	<LI><P><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">The RunOnce, RunOnceEx, and
	RunServicesOnce registry keys</FONT></EM> can be used to run a
	malicious executable at system start-up. What makes this type of
	intrusion particularly insidious is that after the malicious code
	runs at system start-up, the registry entries are automatically
	deleted, thus leaving no trace.</P>
	<LI><P><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A><EM><FONT FACE="Arial Black">Scrap
	objects</FONT></EM> can be created for OLE (Object Linking and
	Embedding) purposes. Again, We&rsquo;ll just quote Jason Fisher's
	explanation: &quot;[Scrap objects] are extremely dangerous because
	they can encapsulate executable code within a compound OLE document
	format.&quot; Further: &quot;There are two additional reasons these
	files are particularly risky, apart from the simple fact that they
	can hide executable code. First, they're often overlooked by
	antivirus software. Even if one of them is included in the list of
	executable application types, the other is often omitted. You should
	ensure that your antivirus program includes both file types. The
	second reason is much more subtle. As it turns out, the SHS and SHB
	extensions are always hidden by Explorer, even if you've configured
	Windows to display all file extensions. The reason is that the
	registry keys for these file types include an undocumented value,
	&quot;NeverShowExt.&quot; If present, this value overrides global
	settings in Windows. For this reason, a virus writer can create a
	scrap object, give it an icon corresponding to an image, then rename
	it something like &quot;Look at This Funny Picture.jpg.&quot; Its
	actual file name, of course, is &quot;Look at This Funny
	Picture.jpg.shs,&quot; but to the unsuspecting user it looks exactly
	like any other image. By the time the realization dawns that the
	file wasn't an image at all, the damage is done.&quot; Initially,
	Scrip 232 turns off the value <I>NeverShowExt</I> for scrap objects,
	making it less likely for a user to inadvertently execute one.</P>
