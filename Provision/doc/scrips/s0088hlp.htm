<H3>Scrip 88 - Network Devices and Services Availability</H3>

<P>Scrip 88 can be used to monitor the availability of all TCP/IP devices and services accessible 
from the local network</p>

<p>This Scrip generates a log only when a device or service it is configured to monitor fails 
to respond.</p>

<p>Scrip 88 supports ICMP and TCP/IP. The availability of devices you wish to monitor can be 
tested from one or more systems on the network eliminating dependence on a single point for 
monitoring network availability.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by Scrip 88.</p>
