<H3>Scrip 26 - Executable Usage Profiler</H3>

<P>Scrip 26 monitors the programs executed on a system on the local network from the time it 
was first enabled.</p>

<p>The list of the processes compiled by Scrip 26 
can be used to identify changes in a system's configuration 
brought about by the installation of applications that don't use common 
installation executables.</p>

<p>This list would also be useful in identifying and analyzing system useage patterns.</p>

<p>The first time execution of a program is detected by Scrip 26, an event is logged on the log database.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in this log.</p>

<p>Another log of the execution of this program is recorded on the log database if its execution 
takes place more than 30 days since the last time it was executed.</p>

<p>The entry for a program in the list of executables maintained by Scrip 26 contains the last 
time execution of the program was detected by the Scrip.</p>

<p>At any time, while Scrip 26 is enabled, you can also get a complete list of the programs being 
tracked by this Scrip by enabling the <em>Dump process execution history</em> parameter.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the <em>Dump process execution history</em> 
log produced when you do this.</p>
