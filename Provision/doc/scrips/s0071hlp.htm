<H3>Scrip 71- Software Removal Detected</H3>

<P>Scrip 71 detects and reports the removal of software applications that when installed 
were registered and appear in the window of the Install/Uninstall tab of the Add/Remove 
Program Properties panel. This Scrip is triggered when the Client detects 
the execution of software removal programs that match the following masks:</p>

<ul>
<li>isuninst.exe</li>
<li>uninst*.exe</li>
<li>unwise*.exe</li>
<li>msiexec.exe</li>
</ul>

<p>Once triggered, Scrip 71 checks the Microsoft registry for changes before reporting 
a successful software removal.</p>
