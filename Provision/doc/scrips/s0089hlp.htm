<p><strong>Please note that this is the detail event log help file for Scrips 89, 212, 213, 214, and 215.
Scrips 212, 213, 214, and 215 are exact copies of Scrip 89.</strong></p>



<H3>Scrip 89 - Scheduled Program Execution</H3>

<P>Scrip 89 executes the program entered in its configuration file on the schedule defined in the Scrip's schedule entry 
in its configuration file. You can enter just the executable 
name (ftp.exe) or a specified path (C:\download\internet\ftp.exe), and any combination of command 
line parameters allowed by the program you want to execute.</p>

<p>If the 
file name does not contain a directory path, the system searches for the executable file in the 
following sequence:</p> 

<ul>
<li>The directory from which the application loaded</li>

<li>The current directory for the parent process</li> 

<li>Windows 95/98: The Windows system directory using the GetSystemDirectory call function to get 
the path of this directory.</li>
<li>Windows NT/2000: The 32-bit Windows system directory using the 
GetSystemDirectory function to get the path of this directory. The name of this 
directory is System32</li>

<li>Windows NT/2000: The 16-bit Windows system directory. There is no Win32 
function that obtains the path of this directory, but it is searched. The name 
of this directory is System</li>

<li>The Windows directory using the GetWindowsDirectory function to get the path 
of this directory</li>

<li>The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable</li>
</ul>

<p>MS-DOS commands can be executed by Scrip 89 using the command.com executable. For example, 
if you wanted to copy some files using the <em>copy</em> command, you would type:<br><br>
<strong>command /c copy ...</strong><br><br>
Note that using the <em>/c</em> option will close the MS-DOS window 
as soon as the command is completed.</p>
