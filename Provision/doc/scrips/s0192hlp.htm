<H3>Scrip 192 - Program execution control</H3>

<P>Scrip 192 enables the automated termination of programs as identified in the Scrip's configuration.</p>

<p> It has two modes of operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop List (default)</li>
<li>Run List</li>
</ul>

<p>In <em>Stop List</em> mode, Scrip 192 will terminate the execution of any command line listed in its <em>Stop List</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Run List</em> mode, Scrip 192 will only allow execution of programs listed in the <em>Run List</em> of
commonly running programs and of programs entered manually by the user. The <em>Run List</em> of
commonly running programs is created automatically from the list of processes running on the
machine for which the Scrip is being configured.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
