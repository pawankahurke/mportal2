<H3>Scrip 77 - Windows Event Log Change Detected</H3>

<P>Scrip 77 detects and reports the addition of event logs to the 
Application, System and Security logs maintained on systems running Microsoft Windows
NT4, 2000, or XP operating system.</p>

<p>You can use Scrip 77 to also  monitor any custom logs that you may have created. To do this, you would simply 
add the name of the custom log you want this Scrip to monitor to the <em>Event logs to monitor for changes</em> 
list in the Scrip's configuration page.</p>

<p>The table below describes the information contained in the logs produced by this Scrip.</p>
